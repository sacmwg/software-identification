        <t>The Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) Working Group defines an open solution architecture
          that enables network operators to collect and utilize information about endpoint configuration and
          state. This information can be used to enforce policies, monitor endpoint health, and for many other
          activities. Information about the software present on an endpoint is an important consideration for
          such activities. Such information can come from multiple sources, including tag files (such as ISO SWID tags 
	  <xref target="SWID"/>, reports from third party inventory tools, output from package managers, and other
	  sources. The
          attributes defined in this document are used to communicate software inventory evidence, collected from a
	  range of possible sources, from the posture collector on the endpoint to the posture validator on a NEA 
	  Server using the PA-TNC interface,

        <t>This specification defines a new set of PA-TNC attributes, carried over PA-TNC messages, which are used
          to communicate requests for software information and software events, and for conveying that
          information back to a NEA Server.</t>
        
        <t>Possession of a list of an endpoint's installed software is very useful in understanding and maintaining the
          security state of an enterprise. For example, if an enterprise policy requires the presence of certain
          pieces of software and/or prohibits the presence of other software, reported software inventory
	  lists can be used to
          indicate compliance or non-compliance with these requirements. Software
          presence and the patch level of that software can be compared to vulnerability or threat alerts to
          determine an endpoint's exposure to attack. All of these uses make an understanding of an endpoint's 
	  software collection highly
          useful to NEA Servers and other enterprise security applications.</t>
        
        <t>Before reading this specification any further, the reader should review and understand the NEA reference
          architecture as described in the Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA): Overview and 
	  Requirements <xref target="RFC5209"/>. 
	  The reader should also
          understand the capabilities and requirements common to PA-TNC interfaces as defined in 
	  RFC 5792 <xref target="RFC5792"/>.</t>
	<t>This document is based on standards published by the Trusted Computing Group's Trusted Network 
	  Communications (TNC)
	  workgroup. The TNC and NEA architectures are interoperable and the following components are equivalent:</t>

      <section title="Definitions">
        <t>This section defines terms with special meaning within this document.</t>
          <t>SW-PC - A Posture Collector (PC) that conforms to this specification. Note that
          such a posture collector might also support other PA-TNC exchanges beyond Software Message and Attributes 
	  for PA-TNC.</t>
          <t>SW-PV - A Posture Validator (PV) that conforms to this specification. Note that
          such a posture verifier might also support other PA-TNC exchanges beyond Software Message and Attributes 
	  for PA-TNC.</t>
	  <t>SW Attribute - This is a PA-TNC attribute (as defined in RFC 5792 <xref target="RFC5792"/> extension
	  for conveying software inventory information. This specification defines several new attribute types.</t>
          <t>Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection - The set of information regarding the set of 
	  software installed on an endpoint and expressed using one of the Software Message and Attributes 
	  data models, as described in the Software Data Model IANA table (see <xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/>. 
	  An endpoint's software inventory evidence 
	  collection might include information created by or derived from
          multiple sources, including but not limited to SWID tag files deposited on the file system during
          software installation, information generated to report output from software discovery tools, and information
	  dynamically generated by a software or package management system on an endpoint.</t>
	  <t>Software Inventory Evidence Record - The endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection is composed
	  of "records". Each record corresponds to one installed instance of a particular software product as reported by some
	  data source. It is
	  possible for a single installed instance to have multiple software inventory evidence records in an endpoint's
	  Software Inventory Evidence Collection - this can happen if multiple sources all report the same software
	  installation instance. </t>
	  <t>Software Identifier - A string associated with a specific version of a specific software product. 
	  Each supported Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC data model has its own rules for how a Software 
	  Identifier (see <xref target="software-identifiers"/>) is derived from the representation of the 
	  given software product using that data model, 
	  and different sources for this information might populate relevant information differently. As such, 
	  while each Software Identifier uniquely identifies a specific software product, the same software product 
	  might be associated with multiple Software Identifiers reflecting differences between different information
	  sources and supported data models.</t>

    <section title="Background">
      <section anchor="Supported-use-cases" title="Supported Use Cases">
        <t>This section describes the Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC use cases supported by this
          specification. The primary use of exchanging software inventory information over the PA-TNC interface is to
          enable a challenger (e.g. NEA Server) to obtain inventory evidence about some system in a way that
          conforms to NEA procedures and expressed using a standard format.
          Collected software information can support a range of security activities including determining whether an
          endpoint is permitted to connect to the enterprise, determining which endpoints contain software that
          requires patching, and similar activities.</t>
        
        <section title="Use Software Inventory as a Factor in Determining Endpoint Access">
          <t>Some enterprises might define security policies that require connected endpoints to have certain
            pieces of security software installed. By contrast, some security policies might prevent access by
            endpoints that have certain prohibited pieces of software installed, such as applications that pose
            known security risks. To support such policies, the NEA Server needs to collect evidence indicating the
            software inventory of an endpoint that is seeking to initiate or continue connectivity to the enterprise.</t>
          
          <t>Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC facilitates policy decisions that consider an endpoint's
            software inventory by providing the NEA Server with software inventory information from the endpoint. 
	    The
            SW-PC can provide a complete or partial inventory to the SW-PV as required to determine
            policy compliance. The SW-PV can then use this as evidence of compliance or non-compliance
            with enterprise policy.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Maintain a Central Repository Reflecting an Endpoint's Software Inventory">
          <t>Many tools can use information about an endpoint's software inventory to monitor and enforce the
            security of an enterprise. For example, a software patching service can use an endpoint's software
            inventory to determine whether certain endpoints have software that requires patching. A vulnerability
            management tool might identify endpoints with known vulnerabilities (patched or otherwise) and use
            this to gauge enterprise exposure to attack. A license management tool might verify that all copies of
            a particular piece of software are accounted for within the enterprise. The presence of a central
            repository representing a real-time understanding of each endpoint's software inventory facilitates all
            such activities. Using a central repository that can ensure the freshness of its collected information is
            generally more efficient than having each tool collect the same inventory information from each
            endpoint individually and leads to a more consistent understanding of enterprise state.</t>
          
          <t>Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC supports this activity through a number of mechanisms. As
            noted above, it allows a SW-PC to provide a complete list of software present in an endpoint's
            Software Inventory Evidence Collection to the SW-PV, which can then pass this information on to a 
	    central repository
            such as a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) or similar application. In addition, SW-PCs
            are required to be able to monitor for changes to an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection 
	    in near real-time
            and push reports of changes to the SW-PV as soon as those changes are detected. Thus
            any central repository fed by a SW-PV receiving such information can be updated soon after the
            change occurs. Keeping such a central repository synchronized with the state of each endpoint's
            Software Inventory Evidence Collection allows tools that use this information for their own 
	    security activities to make
            decisions in a consistent, efficient manner.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="PA-TNC Use Cases">
          <t>Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC are intended to operate over the PA-TNC interface and, as such,
            are intended to meet the use cases set out in the PA-TNC specification.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Non-supported Use Cases">
        <t>Some use cases not covered by this version of Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC include:</t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>This specification does not address how the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection is populated. In
            particular, NEA components are not expected to perform software discovery activities beyond
            compiling information in an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. 
	    This collection might potentially come
            from multiple sources on the endpoint (e.g., information generated dynamically by package
            management tools or discovery tools, as well as SWID tag files discovered on the file system).
            While an enterprise might make use of software discovery procedures to identify installed
            software such procedures
            are outside the scope of this specification.</t>
          <t>This specification does not address converting inventory information expressed in a proprietary
            format into the standard format used in the messages described in this specification. Instead, it
            focuses exclusively on defining interfaces for the transportation of software information in the expectation
            that this is the format around which reporting tools will converge.</t>
          <t>This specification provides no mechanisms for a posture validator to request a specific list of software 
	    information based on
            arbitrary software properties. For example, requesting only information about
            software from a particular vendor is not supported. After the endpoint's software inventory evidence 
	    collection has
            been copied to some central location, such as the CMDB, processes there can perform queries
            based on any criteria present in the collected information, but this specification does not address
            using such queries to constrain the initial collection of this information from the endpoint.</t>
          <t>This specification does not address utilization of properties of certain sources of software information
	    that might facilitate
            local tests (i.e., on the endpoint) of endpoint state. For example, the optional
            package_footprint field of an ISO SWID tag can contain a list of files and hash values associated
            with the software indicated by the tag. Tools on the endpoint can use the values in this field to
            test for the presence of the indicated files. Successful evaluation of such tests leads to greater
            assurance that the indicated software is present on the endpoint. Currently, most SWID tag
            creators do not provide values for tag fields that support local testing. For this reason, the added
            complexity of supporting endpoint testing using these fields is out of scope for this specification.
            Future versions of this specification might add support for such testing.</t>

      <section title="Specification Requirements">

            <t>The NEA architecture enables delay of network access until the endpoint is determined not
            to pose a security threat to the network based on its asserted integrity information. To
            minimize user frustration, the Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC ought to minimize
            overhead delays and make PA-TNC communications as rapid and efficient as possible.</t>
            
            <t>Efficiency is also important when one considers that some network endpoints are small and
            low powered, some networks are low bandwidth and/or high latency, and some transport protocols
            (such as PT-EAP, Posture Transport (PT) Protocol for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
            Tunnel Methods <xref target="RFC7171"/>) or their underlying carrier protocol might allow
            only one packet in flight at a time or only one roundtrip. However, when the underlying PT
            protocol imposes fewer constraints on communications, this protocol ought to be capable of
            taking advantage of more robust communication channels (e.g. using larger messages or
            multiple roundtrips).</t>

        <t>Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC needs to be usable in enterprises that contain tens
          of thousands of endpoints or more. As such, it needs to allow a security tools to make decisions based
          on up-to-date information about an endpoint's software inventory without creating an
          excessive burden on the enterprise's network.</t>

        <t>This specification defines the protocol for how PCs and PVs can exchange and use software information
	  to provide a NEA Server with information about an endpoint's software inventory. Therefore a

     <section title="Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC Diagram Conventions">
        <t>This specification defines the syntax of the Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC using diagrams.
          Each diagram depicts the format and size of each field in bits. Implementations MUST send the bits
          in each diagram as they are shown from left to right for each 32-bit quantity traversing the diagram
          from top to bottom. Multi-octet fields representing numeric values MUST be sent in network (big

        <t>Descriptions of bit fields (e.g. flags) values refer to the position of the bit within the field. These bit

    <section title="Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC System Requirements">
      <t>The Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC specification facilitates the exchange of software
        inventory and event information. Specifically, each application supporting Software Message and
        Attributes for PA-TNC includes a component known as the SW-PC that receives messages sent with
        the SW Attributes component type. The SW-PC is also responsible for sending appropriate
        SW Attributes back to the SW-PV in response. This section outlines what
        software inventories and events are and the requirements
        on SW-PCs and SW-PVs in order to support the stated use cases of this specification.</t>
      <section anchor="Basic-exchange" title="Basic Inventory Exchange">
        <t>In the most basic exchange supported by this specification, a SW-PV sends a request to the
          SW-PC requesting all inventory information in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. This simple
          exchange is shown in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>.</t>

        <t>Upon receiving such a SW Request from the SW-PV, the SW-PC is expected to collect all inventory
	  information from the endpoint's software evidence collection and place it within its
          response attribute.</t>
        <t>SW-PVs MUST discard without error any SW Response attributes that they receive for which
          they do not know the SW Request parameters that led to this SW Response. This is due to the
          fact that the SW Request includes parameters that control the nature of the response (as will be
          described in the following sections) and without knowing those parameters the SW Response
          cannot be reliably interpreted. Most often receiving an unsolicited SW Response attribute happens
          when a NEA Server has multiple SW-PVs; one SW-PV sends a SW Request but, unless exclusive
          delivery is used by the SW-PC in sending the response, both SW-PVs receive copies of the
          resulting SW Response. In this case, the SW-PV that didn't send the SW Request would lack
          the context necessary to correctly interpret the SW Response it received and would simply discard
          it. Note, however, that proprietary measures might allow a SW-PV to discover the SW Request
          parameters for a SW Response even if that SW-PV did not send the given SW Request. As
          such, there is no blanket requirement for a SW-PV to discard all SW Responses to SW
          Request the SW-PV did not generate itself, only that SW-PVs are required to discard SW
          Responses for which they cannot get the necessary context to interpret.</t>
        <t>In the case that it is possible to do so, the SW-PC SHOULD send its SW Response attribute to the
          SW-PV that requested it using exclusive delivery as described in section 4.5 of RFC 5793 
	  (PB-TNC) <xref target="RFC5793"/>. Exclusive delivery ensures that only the sender of the SW Request receives the
          resulting SW Response.</t>

      <section anchor="software-identifiers" title="Software Identifiers">
        <t>Software information records contain a large amount of descriptive information about installed software
	  products. However, in many cases the complete level of detail in these records is not necessary. For example,
	  if one is simply tracking the installation or removal of known software products, one only needs enough
	  information to recognize the software added or removed. To allow such uses to be efficiently supported,
	  Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC supports the use of Software Identifiers.</t>
	  <t>A Software Identifier uniquely identifies a specific version of a specific software product. 
	  The Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC specification does not dictate the structure of a 
	  Software Identifier (beyond stating that it is a string) or define how it is created. Instead, 
	  each data model described in the Software Data Model IANA table (<xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/> 
	  includes its own rules for how a Software Identifier is created based on a record in the Endpoint's 
	  Software Inventory Evidence Collection expressed in that data model. Within the Software Message and 
	  Attributes for PA-TNC specification, the Software Identifier is simply an opaque string.</t>
	  <t>Software Identifiers allow SW Response messages to identify software to a server at a fraction 
	  of the bandwidth that would be needed to send the entire associated record. For some combinations 
	  of data models and sources, the full record might never be necessary as the identifier can be 
	  directly correlated to the contents of the full record. This is possible with authoritative 
	  SWID tags, since these tags always have the same contents and thus a Software Identifier derived 
	  from these tags can be used as a lookup to a local copy of the full tag. For other combinations of 
	  source and data model, a server might not be able to determine the specific software product and 
	  version associated with the identifier without requesting deliver of the full record. In either case, 
	  however, a SW-PV can use Software Identifiers to track the presence of specific software products on 
	  an endpoint over time in a bandwidth-efficient manner.</t>
	  <t>There are two important limitations of Software Identifiers to keep in mind:
	  <list>
	    <t>	The identifiers do not necessarily change when the associated record changes. In some 
	    situations, a record in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection will change 
	    due to new information becoming available or in order to correct prior errors in that information. 
	    Such changes might or might not result in changes to the Software Identifier, depending on the 
	    nature of the changes and the rules governing how Software Identifiers are derived from records 
	    of the appropriate data model. </t>
	    <t>It is possible that a single software product is installed on a single endpoint multiple times. 
	    If both of these installation instances are reported by the same source using the same data format, 
	    then this will result in identical Software Identifiers for each installation instances. In other 
	    words, Software Identifiers do not uniquely identify installation instances; they just uniquely 
	    identify software products (which might have more than one installation instance). Instead, 
	    to distinguish between multiple instances of a single software product, one needs to make use 
	    of Record Identifiers, described in the following section.</t>
	  </list></t>
      <section title="Record Identifiers" anchor="record_identifiers">
	<t>A Record Identifier is a string generated by the SW-PC that is uniquely associated with a specific 
	record within the Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. The SW-PC MUST assign a unique 
	identifier to each record when it is added to the Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. 
	The Record Identifier SHOULD remain unchanged if that record is modified. The SWID-PC might wish to 
	assign Record Identifiers sequentially, but any scheme is acceptable provided that no two records receive 
	the same identifier.</t>
	<t>Servers can use Record Identifiers to distinguish between multiple instances of a single software 
	product installed on an endpoint. Since each installation instance of a software product is associated 
	with a separate record, servers can use the record identifier to distinguish between instances. For 
	example, if an event is reported (as described in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>), the record 
	identifier will allow the server to discern which instance of a software product is involved.</t>
      </section>
        <section anchor="Using-record-identifiers-in-SW-attributes" title="Using Software and Record Identifiers in SW Attributes">
          <t>A SW Attribute reporting an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection can contain Software Identifiers
            instead of copies of software inventory evidence records. The message exchange is identical to the diagram
            shown in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>, 
	    but the contents of the SW Response are Software Identifiers instead
            of evidence records. The SW Request attribute indicates whether the response is required to use full records or
            Software Identifiers. Using Software Identifiers can reduce the attribute size of the response
            by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to sending the same inventory using full records. A
            SW-PC responds to a SW Request attribute requesting Software Identifiers the same
            way it responds to a request for full software records, except that instead of copying each record entirely
            into the attribute body of the response, it provides the specific values that comprise a Software
            Identifier for each record.</t>
	    <t>All SW Response attributes include Record Identifiers for each reported record. This is true 
	    regardless of whether the record is delivered in full or represented by a Software Identifier.</t>

      </section>
      <section anchor="Targeted-requests" title="Targeted Requests">
        <t>Sometimes a SW-PV does not require information about every piece of software on an endpoint but only needs
          to receive updates about certain software instances. For example, enterprise endpoints might be required to
	  have certain software products installed and to keep these updated. Instead of requesting a complete inventory 
	  just to see if these products are present, the SW-PV can make a "targeted request" for the software in question.</t>
          <t>Targeted requests follow the same message exchange described in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>. 
	  The SW-PV targets
          its request by providing one or more Software Identifiers in its SW Request attribute. The SW-PC
          MUST then limit its response to contain only records that match the indicated Software Identifier(s). This
          allows the network exchange to exclude information that is not relevant to a given policy question,
          thus reducing unnecessary bandwidth consumption. The SW-PC's response might consist of full
          records or of Software Identifiers, depending on the parameters of the SW Request.</t>
          <t>Note that targeted requests identify the software relevant to the request only through Software 
          Identifiers. This specification does not support arbitrary, parameterized querying of
          records. For example, one cannot request all records from a certain software publisher, or all records created
          by a particular record source. Targeted requests only allow a requestor to request specific software (as
          identified by their Software Identifiers) and receive a response that is limited to the named software.</t>
	  <t>There is
          no assumption that a SW-PC will recognize "synonymous records" - that is, records from different sources
          for the same software. Recall that different sources and data models may use different Software Identifier 
	  strings for the same software product. The SW-PC returns only records that match the Software Identifiers
          in the SW Request, even if there might be other records in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
          for the same software product. This is necessary because SW-PCs might not have the ability to determine 
	  that two Software Identifiers refer to the same product.</t>
	  <t>Targeted requests do not include Record Identifiers. The response to a targeted request MUST 
	  include all records associated with the named Software Identifiers, including the case where 
	  there are multiple records associated with a single Software Identifier.</t>
          <t>SW-PCs MUST accept targeted requests and process them correctly as described above. SW-PVs
          MUST be capable of making targeted requests and processing the responses thereto.</t>

      <section anchor="Monitoring-changes-in-an-endpoint" 
	       title="Monitoring Changes in an Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection">
        <t>The software collection on an endpoint is not static. As software is installed, uninstalled, patched, or
          updated, the Software Inventory Evidence Collection is expected to change to reflect the new software state on the
          endpoint. Different record sources might update the evidence collection at different rates. For example, a
	  package manager might update its records in the Software Inventory Evidence Collection immediately whenever
	  it is used to add or remove a software product. By contrast, sources that perform periodic examination of the
	  endpoint would likely only update their records in the Software Inventory Evidence Collection after each
	  examination.</t>
          <t>All SW-PCs MUST be able to be able to detect changes to the Software Inventory Evidence Collection. 
	  Specifically, SW-PCs MUST be able to detect:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The creation of records</t>
            <t>The deletion of records</t>
            <t>The alteration of records</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>An "alteration" is anything that modifies the contents of a record (or would modify it, if the record
          is dynamically generated on demand) in any way, regardless of whether the change is functionally
          meaningful. </t>
          <t>SW-PCs MUST detect such changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection in close to real-time
          (i.e., within seconds) when the Posture Collector is operating. In addition, in the case where there is a period during
          which the SW-PC is not operating, the SW-PC MUST be able to determine the net change to
          the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection over the period it was not operational. Specifically, the "net
          change" represents the difference between the state of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection when the
          SW-PC was last operational and monitoring its state, and the state of the endpoint's software inventory evidence
          collection when the SW-PC resumed operation. Note that a net change might not reflect the total
          number of change events over this interval. For example, if a record was altered three times
          during a period when the SW-PC was unable to monitor for changes, the net change of this interval
          might only note that there was an alteration to the record, but not how many individual alteration events
          occurred. It is sufficient for a SW-PC's determination of a net change to note that there was a
          difference between the earlier and current state rather than enumerating all the individual events that
          allowed the current state to be reached.</t>
          <t>The SW-PC MUST assign a time to each detected change in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection.
          These timestamps correspond to the SW-PC's best understanding as to when the detected
          change occurred. These timestamps MUST be as accurate as possible. For changes to the
          endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection that occur while the SW-PC is operating, the SW-PC ought to
          be able to assign a time to the event that is accurate to within a few seconds. For changes to the
          endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection that occur while the SW-PC is not operational, upon becoming
          operational the SW-PC needs to make a best guess as to the time of the relevant events (possibly
          by looking at timestamps on files), but these values might be off. In the case of dynamically
          generated records, the time of change is the time at which the data from which the records are
          generate changes, not the time at which a changed record is generated. For example, if records
          are dynamically generated based on data in an RPM database, the time of change would be
          when the RPM record was changed.</t>
        <t>With regard to deletions of records, the SW-PC needs to detect the deletion and MUST retain
          a copy of the full deleted record along with its Record Identifier so that the record itself can 
	  be provided to the SW-PV upon request.
          This copy of the record MUST be retained for a reasonable amount of time. Vendors and
          administrators determine what "reasonable" means, but a copy of the record SHOULD be retained for
          as long as the event recording the deletion of the record remains in the SW-PC's event log (as 
	  described in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>). This is
          recommended because, as long as the event is in the SW-PC's change logs, the SW-PC might
          send an event attribute (described in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>) that references this record, 
	  and a copy of the record is
          needed if the SW-PV wanted a full copy of the relevant records.</t>
          <t>With regard to alterations to a record, SW-PCs MUST detect any alterations to the contents
          of a record. Alterations need to be detected even if they have no functional impact on the record. A
          good guideline is that any alteration to a record that might change the value of a hash taken on the record's
          contents needs to be detected by the SW-PC. A SW-PC might be unable to distinguish
          modifications to the content of a record from modifications to the metadata the file system associates
          with the record. For example, a SW-PC might use the "last modification" timestamp as an
          indication of alteration to a given record, but a record's last modification time can change for reasons
          other than modifications to the record contents. A SW-PC is still considered compliant with this
          specification if it also reports metadata change events that do not change the record itself as
          alterations to the record. In other words, while SW-PC authors are encouraged to exclude
          modifications that do not affect the bytes within the record, discriminating between modifications 
	  to file contents and changes to file metadata can be
          difficult and time consuming on some systems. As such, as long as the alterations detected by a
          SW-PC always cover all modifications to the contents of record, the SW-PC is considered
          compliant even if it also registers alterations that do not modify the contents of a record as well. When
          recording an alteration to a record, the SW-PC is only required to note that an alteration occurred.
          The SW-PC is not required to note or record how the record altered, nor is it possible to include
          such details in SW Attributes reporting the change to a SW-PV.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="Reporting-change-events" title="Reporting Change Events">
        <t>As noted in the preceding section, SW-PCs MUST be able to detect changes to the endpoints software inventory
          evidence collection (creation, deletion, and alteration) in near real-time while the SW-PC is
          operational, and MUST be able to account for any net change to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
          that occurs when the SW-PC is not operational. However, to be of use to the enterprise, the NEA Server
          needs to be able to receive these events and be able to understand how new changes relate to earlier
          changes. In Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC, this is facilitated by reporting change events. All
          SW-PCs MUST be capable of receiving requests for change events and sending change event
          attributes. All SW-PVs MUST be capable of requesting and receiving change event attributes.</t>
        <section anchor="Change-event-records" title="Change Event Records">
          <t>A change event record consists of either a complete record or Software Identifier from the changed record along
            with the following pieces of information:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>The nature of the change (i.e., creation, deletion, or lteration)</t>
              <t>An Event Identifier (EID) value</t>
              <t>An EID Epoch value</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>An EID is a 4-byte unsigned integer that the SW-PC assigns sequentially to each observed event
            (whether detected in real-time or deduced by looking for net changes over a period of SW-PC
            inactivity). All EIDs exist within the context of some "EID Epoch", which is also represented as a
            4-byte unsigned integer. EID Epochs are used to ensure synchronization between the SW-PC and
            any SW-PVs with which it communicates. EID Epoch values SHOULD be generated randomly
            and in such a way that it is unlikely that the same EID Epoch is generated twice, even if the SW-PC
            reverted to an earlier state (e.g., resetting it to factory defaults). In the case where a SW-PC
            needs to reset its EID counter, either because it has exhausted all available EID values or because
            the SW-PC's event log becomes corrupted, then a new EID Epoch MUST be selected.</t>
          <t>Within an Epoch, EIDs MUST be assigned sequentially, so that if a particular event is assigned an
            EID of N, the next observed event is given an EID of N+1. In some cases, events might occur
            simultaneously, or the SW-PC might not otherwise be able to determine an ordering for events.
            In these cases, the SW-PC creates an arbitrary ordering of the events and assigns EIDs according
            to this ordering. Two change events MUST NOT ever be assigned the same EID within the same EID
            Epoch. No meaningful comparison can be made between EID values of different Epochs.</t>
            <t>The EID value of 0 is reserved and MUST NOT be associated with any event. Specifically, an EID of
            0 in a SW Request attribute indicates that a SW-PV wants an inventory response rather than
            an event response, while an EID of 0 in a SW Response is used to indicate the initial state of the
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection prior to the observation of any events. Thus the very first recorded
            event in a SW-PC's records within an EID Epoch MUST be assigned a value of 1 or greater.
            Note that EID and EID Epoch values are assigned by the SW-PC without regard to whether events
            are being reported to one or more SW-PVs. The SW-PC records events and assigns EIDs
            during its operation. Any and all SW-PVs that request event information from the SW-PC will
            have those requests served from the same event records and thus will see the same EIDs and EID Epochs
            for the same events.</t>
            <t>The SW-PC MUST ensure there is no coverage gap (i.e., change events that are not recorded in
            the SW-PC's records) in its change event records. This is necessary because a coverage gap
            might give a SW-PV a false impression of the endpoint's state. For example, if a SW-PV saw
            an event indicating that a particular record had been added to the endpoint's software inventory
	    evidence collection, and saw no subsequent events
            indicating that record had been deleted, it might reasonably assume that this record was still present
	    and thus that the indicated software was still installed
            (assuming the Epoch has not changed). If there is a coverage gap in the SW-PC's event records,
            however, this assumption is false. For this reason, the SW-PC's event records MUST NOT contain
            gaps. In the case where there are periods where it is possible that changes occurred without the
            SW-PC detecting or recording them, the SW-PC MUST either compute a net change and
            update its event records appropriately, or pick a new EID Epoch to indicate a discontinuity with previous
            event records.</t>
            <t>Within a given Epoch, once a particular event has been assigned an EID, this association MUST
            NOT be changed. That is, within an Epoch, once an EID is assigned to an event, that EID cannot be
            reassigned to a different event, and the event cannot be assigned a different EID. When the SW-PC's
            Epoch changes, all of these associations between EIDs and events are cancelled, and EID
            values once again become free for assignment.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Updating Inventory Knowledge Based on Events">
          <t>Modern endpoints can have hundreds of software products installed, most of which are unlikely to
            change from one day to the next. As such, instead of exchanging a complete list of an endpoint's
            inventory on a regular basis, one might wish to only identify changes since some earlier known state
            of this inventory. This is readily facilitated by the use of EIDs to place change events in a context
            relative to earlier state.</t>
            <t>Every inventory sent by a SW-PC to a SW-PV (as described in <xref target="Basic-exchange"/> through 
	    <xref target="Targeted-requests"/>)
            includes the EID Epoch and EID of the last event recorded prior to that inventory being compiled.
            This allows the SW-PV to place all subsequently received event records in context relative to this
            inventory (since the EIDs represent a total ordering of all changes to the endpoint's software inventory evidence
            collection). Specifically, a SW-PV (or, more likely, a database that collects and records its findings)
            can record an endpoint's full inventory and also the EID and Epoch of the most recent event reflected
            in that state. From that point on, if change events are observed, the attribute describing these events
            indicates the nature of the change, the affected records, and the order in which these events
            occurred (as indicated by the sequential EIDs). Using this information, any remote record of the
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection can be updated appropriately.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Using-event-records-in-SW-attributes" title="Using Event Records in SW Attributes">
          <t>A SW-PV MUST be able to request a list of event records instead of an inventory. The message
            flow in such an exchange looks the same as the basic flow shown in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>. 
	    The only difference is
            that, in the SW Request attribute, the SW-PV provides an EID other than 0. (A value of 0 in
            these fields represents a request for an inventory.) When the SW-PC receives such a request,
            instead of identifying records from the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection, it consults its list of
            detected changes. The SW-PC MUST add an event record to the SW Response attribute for
            each recorded change event with an EID greater than or equal to the EID in the SW Request
            attribute (although targeting of requests, as described in the next paragraph, might limit this list). A list
            of event records MUST only contain events with EIDs that all come from the current Epoch.</t>
            <t>SW-PVs can target requests for event records by including one or more Software Identifiers, as
            described in <xref target="Targeted-requests"/>, in the SW Request that requests an event record list. 
	    A targeted request
            for event records is used to indicate that only events affecting software that match the provided
            Software Identifiers are to be returned. Specifically, in response to a targeted request for event
            records, the SW-PC MUST exclude any event records that are less than the indicated EID (within
            the current EID Epoch) and exclude any event records where the affected software does not match
            one of the provided Software Identifiers. This might mean that the resulting list of event records sent
            in the response attribute does not provide a continuous sequence of EIDs. Both SW-PCs and
            SWIC-PVs MUST support targeted request for event records.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records" 
		 title="Partial and Complete Lists of Event Records in SW Attributes">
          <t>Over time, a SW-PC might record a large number of change events. If a SW-PV requests all
            change events covering a large period of time, the resulting SW Response attribute might be
            extremely large, especially if the SW-PV is requesting the use of full records instead of the use
            of Software Identifiers (as described in <xref target="Using-record-identifiers-in-SW-attributes"/>). 
	    In the case that the resulting attribute is
            too large to send (either because it exceeds the 4GB attribute size limit imposed by the PA-TNC 
            specification, or because it exceeds some smaller size limit imposed on the SW-PC) the
            SW-PC MAY send a partial list of event records back to the SW-PV.</t>
            <t>Generation of a partial list of events in a SW Response attribute requires the SW-PC to identify
            a "consulted range" of EIDs. A consulted range is the set of event records that are examined for
            inclusion in the SW Response attribute and that are included in that attribute if applicable. Recall
            that, if a SW Request is targeted, only event records that involve the indicated software would
            be applicable. (See <xref target="Targeted-requests"/> for more on Targeted Request.) 
	    If a request is not targeted, all event
            records in the considered range are applicable and included in the SW Response attribute.</t>
            <t>The lower bound of the consulted range MUST be the EID provided in the SW Request. (Recall
            that a SW Request indicates a request for event records by providing a non-0 EID value in the
            SW Request. See <xref target="Using-event-records-in-SW-attributes"/>.) 
	    The upper bound of the consulted range is the EID of the latest
            event record (as ordered by EID values) that is included in the SW Response attribute if it is
            applicable to the request. The EID of this last event record is called the "Last Consulted EID". The
            SW-PC chooses this Last Consulted EID based on the size of the event record list it is willing to
            provide to the SW-PV.</t>
            <t>A partial result list MUST include all applicable event records within the consulted range. This means
            that for any applicable event record (i.e., any event record in an un-targeted request, or an event record
	    associated with software matching a requested Software Identifier in a targeted request)
	    whose EID is greater than or equal to the EID provided in the
            SW Request and whose EID is less than or equal to the Last Consulted EID, that event record
            MUST be included in the SW Response conveying this partial list of event records. This ensures
            that every partial list of event records is always complete within its indicated range.</t>
            <t>All SW Response attributes that convey event records (either using full records or using Software
            Identifiers) include an Epoch, Last EID, and Last Consulted EID field. The Last EID
            contains the EID of the last event record known to the SW-PC at the time that the SW Response
            attribute was generated. The Last EID might or might not be part of the consulted range. As noted
            above, the Last Consulted EID field contains the EID of the last event record in the consulted range.
            The Epoch field contains the EID Epoch associated with the Last EID and Last Consulted EID fields
            as well as all the EIDs in event records contained within the SW Response attribute. Note that, if
            responding to a targeted SW Request, the SW Response attribute might not contain the event
            record whose EID matches the Last Consulted EID value. For example, the last consulted EID record
            might have been deemed inapplicable because it did not match the specified list of Software
            Identifiers in the SW Request.</t>
            <t>If a SW-PV receives a SW Response attribute where the Last EID and Last Consulted EID
            fields are identical, the SW-PV knows that it has received a result list that is complete, given the
            parameters of the request, up to the present time. On the other hand, if the Last EID and Last
            Consulted EID values differ, the SW-PV has received a partial result list. In the latter case, if the
            SW-PV wishes to try to collect the rest of the partially delivered result list it then sends a new
            SW Request whose EID is one greater than the Last Consulted EID in the preceding response.
            Doing this causes the SW-PC to generate another SW Response attribute containing event
            records where the earliest reported event record is the one immediately after the event record with
            the Last Consulted EID (since EIDs are assigned sequentially). By repeating this process until it
            receives a SW Response where the Last EID and Last Consulted EID are equal, the SW-PV is
            able to collect all event records over a given range, even if the complete set of event records would
            be too large to deliver via a single attribute.</t>
            <t>Implementers need to be aware that a SW Request might specify an EID that is greater than the
            EID of the last event recorded by a SW-PC. In accordance with the behaviors described in 
	    <xref target="Using-event-records-in-SW-attributes"/>,
            a SW-PC MUST respond to such a request with a SW Response attribute of the
            appropriate type (using full records or Software Identifiers as specified in the SW Request)
            that contains zero event records. This is because the SW-PC has recorded no event records with
            EIDs greater than or equal to the EID in the SW Request. In such a case, the Last Consulted EID
            field MUST be set to the same value as the Last EID field in this SW Response attribute. This case
            is called out because the consulted range on a SW-PC in such a situation is a negative range, where
            the "first" EID in the range (provided in the SW Request) is greater than the "last" EID in the range
            (this being the EID of the last recorded event on the SW-PC). Implementers need to ensure that
            SW-PCs do not experience problems in such a circumstance.</t>
            <t>Note that this specification only supports the returning of partial results when returning event records.
            There is no way to return a partial inventory list under this specification.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Synchronizing-event-identifiers-and-epochs" title="Synchronizing Event Identifiers and Epochs">
          <t>Since EIDs are sequential within an Epoch, if a SW-PV's list of event records contains gaps in the
            EID values within a single Epoch, the SW-PV knows that there are events that have not been
            accounted for. The SW-PV can either request a new event list to collect the missing events or
            request a full inventory to re-sync its understanding of the state of the Endpoint's Software Inventory
	    Evidence Collection. In
            either case, after the SW-PV's record of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection has been updated,
            the SW-PV can record the new latest EID value and track events normally from that point on.</t>
            <t>If the SW-PV receives any attribute from a SW-PC where the EID Epoch differs from the EID
            Epoch that was used previously, then SW-PV or any entity using this information to track the
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection knows that there is a discontinuity in their understanding of the
            endpoint's state. To move past this discontinuity and reestablish a current understanding of the state
            of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection, the SW-PV needs to receive a full inventory from the
            endpoint. The SW-PV cannot be brought in sync with the endpoint's state through the collection of any
	    set of event records in this situation.
	    This is because it is not possible to account for all events on the SW-PC over the interval
            since the previous Epoch was used, because there is no way to query for EIDs from a previous
            Epoch. Once the SW-PV has received a full inventory for the new Epoch, the SW-PV records
            the latest EID reported in this new Epoch and can track further events normally.</t>
            <t>A SW-PC MUST NOT report events with EIDs from any Epoch other than the current EID Epoch.
            The SW-PC MAY choose to purge all event records from a previous Epoch from memory after an
            Epoch change. Alternately, the SW-PC MAY choose to retain some event records from a previous
            EID Epoch and assign them new EIDs in the current Epoch. However, in the case where a SW-PC
            chooses the latter option it MUST ensure that the order of events according to their EIDs is
            unchanged and that there is no coverage gap between the first retained event recorded during the
            previous Epoch (now reassigned with an EID in the current Epoch) and the first event recorded during
            the current Epoch. In particular, the SW-PC MUST ensure that all change events that occurred
            after the last recorded event from the previous Epoch are known and recorded. (This might not be
            possible if the Epoch change is due to state corruption on the SW-PC.) A SW-PC might choose
            to reassign EIDs to records from a preceding Epoch to create a "sliding window" of events, where
            each Epoch change represents a shift in the window of available events.</t>
            <t>In the case where a SW-PC suffers a crash and loses track of its current EID Epoch or current
            EID, then it MUST generate a new EID Epoch value and begin assigning EIDs within that Epoch. In
            this case, the SW-PC MUST purge all event records from before the crash as it cannot ensure
            that there is not a gap between the last of those records and the next detected event. The process
            for generating a new EID Epoch MUST minimize the possibility that the newly generated EID Epoch
            is the same as a previously used EID Epoch.</t>
            <t>The SW-PV will normally never receive an attribute indicating that the latest EID is less than the
            latest EID reported in a previous attribute within the same EID Epoch. If this occurs, the SW-PC
            has suffered an error of some kind, possibly indicative of at least partial corruption of its event log. In
            this case, the SW-PV SHOULD treat the situation as if there was a change in Epoch and treat any
            local copy of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection as out-of-sync until a full inventory can be reported
            by the SW-PC. In this case, the SW-PV SHOULD flag the occurrence so the SW-PC can be examined to
            ensure it is now operating properly.</t>

     <section anchor="subscriptions" title="Subscriptions">
        <t>Thus far, all message exchanges discussed assume that a SW-PV sent an SW Request
          attribute and the SW-PC is providing a direct response to that request. The Software Message and
          Attributes for PA-TNC specification also supports the ability for a SW-PC to send a message with a
          SW Attribute to the SW-PV in response to observed changes in the endpoint's software inventory evidence
          collection, instead of in direct response to a SW Request. An agreement by a SW-PC to send
          content when certain changes are detected to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection is referred to in this
          specification as a "subscription", and the SW-PV that receives this content is said to be

            attribute with the Subscription flag set. The SW Request attribute is otherwise identical to the SW
            Requests discussed in previous sections. Specifically, such a SW Request might request full records
            or Software Identifiers, might be targeted, and might request change event records or endpoint
            inventory. Assuming no error is encountered, a SW-PC MUST send a SW Response attribute
            in direct response to this SW Request attribute, just as if the Subscription flag was not set. As such,
            the message exchange that establishes a new subscription in a SW-PC has the same flow seen
            in the previous message exchanges, as depicted in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>. 
	    If the SW-PV does not receive a

            and the SW-PV. Only the subscription experiencing the error is cancelled and other subscriptions
            are unaffected. See <xref target="Error-handling"/> for more on this error condition.</t>
            <t>Finally, a subscription is terminated if the connection between the SW-PC and SW-PV is
            deleted. This occurs when the connection ID used in the messages between the SW-PC and the SW-PV
	    becomes unbound. Loss of this connection ID would prevent the SW-PC from sending messages in fulfillment
	    of this subscription. As such, loss of the connection ID necessarily forces subscription termination
	    between the affected parties.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Subscription Status">
          <t>A SW-PV can request that a SW-PC report the list of active subscriptions where the SW-PV
            is the subscriber. A SW-PV can use this to recover lost information about active subscriptions.
            A SW-PV can also use this capability to verify that a SW-PC has not forgotten any of its
            subscriptions. The latter is especially useful where a SW-PC does not send any attributes in
            fulfillment of a given subscription for a long period of time. The SW-PV can check the list of active
            subscriptions on the SW-PC and verify whether the inactivity is due to a lack of reportable events,
            or due to the SW-PC forgetting its obligations to fulfill a given subscription.</t>
            <t>A SW-PV requests a list of its subscriptions on a given SW-PC by sending that SW-PC a
            Subscription Status Request. The SW-PC MUST then respond with a Subscription Status
            Response (or a PA-TNC Error if an error condition is experienced). The Subscription Status Response
            MUST contain one subscription record for each of the active subscriptions for which the SW-PV is the
            subscribing party. </t>

        <section title="Fulfilling Subscriptions">
          <t>As noted in <xref target="Monitoring-changes-in-an-endpoint"/> SW-PCs MUST have the ability 
	    to automatically detect changes to an
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection in near real-time. For every active subscription, the SW-PC MUST
            send an attribute to the subscribed SW-PV whenever a change is detected to relevant records within
            the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. Such an attribute is said to be sent "in
            fulfillment of" the given subscription and any such attribute MUST include that subscription's Subscription
            ID. If the establishing request for that subscription was a targeted request, then only records that match
            the Software Identifiers provided in that establishing request are considered relevant. Otherwise,
            (i.e., for non-targeted requests) any record is considered relevant for this purpose.

          <t>The contents of an attribute sent in fulfillment of a subscription depend on the parameters provided
            in the establishing request for that subscription. Specifically, the contents of an attribute sent in
            fulfillment of a subscription have the same format as would a direct response to the establishing
            request. For example, if the establishing request stipulated a response that contained an event record
            list wherein affected software indicated using Software Identifiers, all attributes sent
            in fulfillment of this subscription will also consist of event record lists expressed using Software
            Identifiers. As such, all SW Responses displayed in the exchange depicted in 
	    <xref target="Subscription-establishment-and-fulfillment"/>
            have the same format. A SW Response generated in fulfillment of an active subscription MUST be
            a valid SW Response attribute according to all the rules outlined in the preceding sections. In other
            words, an attribute constructed in fulfillment of a subscription will look the same as an attribute sent
            in direct response to an explicit request from a SW-PV that had the same request parameters and
            which arrived immediately after the given change event. There are a few special rules that expand
            on this guideline:</t>
          <section title="Subscriptions Reporting Inventories">
            <t>In the case that a SW-PV subscribes to a SW-PC requesting an inventory attribute whenever
              changes are detected (i.e. the EID in the establishing request is 0), then the SW-PC MUST send
              the requested inventory whenever a relevant change is detected. (A "relevant change" is any change
              for untargeted requests, or a change to an indicated record in a targeted request.) Upon detection
              of a relevant change for an active subscription, the SW-PC sends the appropriate inventory
              information as if it had just received the establishing request. Attributes sent in fulfillment of this
              subscription will probably have a large amount of redundancy, as the same records are likely to be
              present in each of these SW Attributes. The role of an inventory subscription is not to report records
              just for the items that changed - that is the role of a subscription that reports events (see 
              <xref target="Subscriptions-reporting-events"/>). A SW-PC MUST NOT exclude a 
	      record from an attribute sent in fulfillment of an inventory
              subscription simply because that record was not involved in the triggering event (although a record might
              be excluded for other reasons, such as if the subscription is targeted - see 
	      <xref target="Targeted-subscriptions"/>).</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="Subscriptions-reporting-events" title="Subscriptions Reporting Events">
            <t>The way in which a SW-PV indicates it wishes to establish a subscription requesting event records
              is by providing a non-zero EID in the SW Request establishing the subscription 
	      (see <xref target="Change-event-records"/>).
              However, when the SW-PC constructs an attribute in fulfillment of the subscription (other than the
              direct response to the establishing request), it MUST only include event records for the detected
              change(s) that precipitated this response attribute. In other words, it MUST NOT send a complete list
              of all changes starting with the indicated EID, up through the latest change, every time a new event
              is detected. In effect, the EID in the establishing request is treated as being updated every time an
              attribute is sent in fulfillment of this subscription, such that a single event is not reported twice in
              fulfillment of a single subscription. As such, every SW-PC MUST track the EID of the last event
              that triggered an attribute for the given subscription. When the next event (or set of events) is
              detected, the SW-PC MUST only report events with EIDs after the last reported event. In the case that the EID Epoch of
              the SW-PC changes, the SW-PC MUST treat EID values in the new Epoch as being after all
              EIDs assigned in the previous Epoch regardless of the relative numeric values of these EIDs.</t>
              <t>Note that while a subscription is active, the subscribing SW-PV MAY make other requests for
              event records that overlap with events that are reported in fulfillment of a subscription. Such requests are
              unaffected by the presence of the subscription, nor is the subscription affected by such requests. In
              other words, a given request will get the same results back whether or not there was a subscription.
              Likewise, an attribute sent in fulfillment of a subscription will contain the same information whether or
              not other requests had been received from the SW-PV.</t>
              <t>A SW-PV needs to pay attention to the EID Epoch in these messages, as changes in the Epoch
              might create discontinuities in the SW-PV's understanding of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
              state, as discussed in <xref target="Synchronizing-event-identifiers-and-epochs"/>. 
	      In particular, once the EID Epoch changes, a SW-PV is unable
              have confidence that it has a correct understanding of the state of an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
              until after the SW-PV collects a complete inventory.</t>
              <t>SW-PCs MAY send partial lists of event records in fulfillment of a subscription. 
	      (See <xref target="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records"/>
              for more on partial list of event records.) In the case that a SW-PC sends a partial list of event
              records, it MUST immediately send the next consecutive partial list, and continue doing so until it has
              sent the equivalent of the complete list of event records. In other words, if the SW-PC sends a
              partial list it does not wait for another change event to send another SW Response, but continues
              sending SW Responses until it has sent all event records that would have been included in a
              complete fulfillment of the subscription.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="Targeted-subscriptions" title="Targeted Subscriptions">
            <t>Subscriptions MAY be targeted to only apply to records that match a given set of Software Identifiers. In the
              case where changes are detected that affect multiple records, some matching the establishing request's
              Software Identifiers and some not, the attribute sent in fulfillment of the subscription MUST only include
              inventory or events (as appropriate) for records that match the establishing request's Software Identifiers. The
              SW-PC MUST NOT include non-matching records in the attribute, even if those non-matching records
              experienced change events that were co-temporal with change events on the matching records.</t>
              <t>In addition, a SW-PC MUST send an attribute in fulfillment of a targeted subscription only when
              changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection impact one or more records matching the subscription's
              establishing request's Software Identifiers. A SW-PC MUST NOT send any attribute in fulfillment of a
              targeted subscription based on detected change to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection that did not
              involve any of the records targeted by that subscription.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="No-subscription-consolidation" title="No Subscription Consolidation">
            <t>A SW-PV MAY establish multiple subscriptions to a given SW-PC. If this is the case, it is
              possible that a single change event on the endpoint might require fulfillment by multiple subscriptions,
              and that the information included in attributes that fulfill each of these subscriptions might overlap.
              The SW-PC MUST send separate attributes for each established subscription that requires a
              response due to the given event. Each of these attributes MUST contain all information required to
              fulfill that individual subscription, even if that information is also sent in other attributes sent in
              fulfillment of other subscriptions at the same time. In other words, SW-PCs MUST NOT attempt
              to combine information when fulfilling multiple subscriptions simultaneously, even if this results in
              some redundancy in the attributes sent to the SW-PV.</t>
          </section>
          <section title="Delayed Subscription Fulfillment">
            <t>A SW-PC MAY delay the fulfillment of a subscription following a change event in the interest of
              waiting to see if additional change events are forthcoming and, if so, conveying the relevant records
              back to the SW-PV in a single SW Response attribute. This can help reduce network bandwidth
              consumption between the SW-PC and the SW-PV. For example, consider a situation where
              10 changes occur a tenth of a second apart. If the SW-PC does not delay in assembling and
              sending SW Response attributes, the SW-PV will receive 10 separate SW Response
              attributes over a period of 1 second. However, if the SW-PC waits half a second after the initial
              event before assembling a SW Response, the SW-PV only receives two SW Response
              attributes over the same period of time.</t>
              <t>Note that the ability to consolidate events for a single subscription over a given period of time does
              not contradict the rules in <xref target="No-subscription-consolidation"/> prohibiting 
	      consolidation across multiple subscriptions.
              When delaying fulfillment of subscriptions, SW-PCs are still required to fulfill each individual
              subscription separately. Moreover, in the case that change events within the delay window cancel
              each other out (e.g., a record is deleted and then re-added), the SW-PC MUST still report each
              change event rather than just reporting the net effect of changes over the delay period. In other words,
              delayed fulfillment can decrease the number of attributes send by the SW-PC, but it does not
              reduce the total number of change events reported.</t>
              <t>SW-PCs are not required to support delayed fulfillment of subscriptions. However, in the case that
              the SW-PC does support delayed subscription fulfillment, it MUST be possible to configure the
              SW-PC to disable delayed fulfillment. In other words, parties deploying SW-PCs need to be
              allowed to disable delayed subscription fulfillment in their SW-PCs. The manner in which such
              configuration occurs is left to the discretion of implementers, although implementers MUST protect
              the configuration procedure from unauthorized tampering. In other words, there needs to be some
              assurance that unauthorized individuals are not able to introduce long delays in subscription
              fulfillment.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Multiple Sources of Software Inventory Evidence Records">
        <t>The records in an endpoint's software inventory evidence
	  collection might potentially come
          from multiple sources. For example, records might be derived from ISO SWID tags deposited on the file system and collected
          therefrom. Records might also be generated by tools such as software and package
          managers (e.g., RPM or YUM) or might be translated from software discovery reports.</t>
          <t>A SW-PC is not required to identify every possible source of software information on its endpoint. Some
          SW-PCs might be explicitly tied only to one or a handful of software inventory sources. 
	  For all software inventory evidence sources that a particular SW-PC
          supports, it MUST completely support all requirements of this specification with regard to those sources. 
	  In other words, for supported sources, the SW-PC is required to be capable
          of providing a complete set of the provided software inventory evidence records; 
	  monitoring for changes in the records reported by those sources, 
	  correctly providing responses for both full and targeted requests that include records from those sources, and
          providing either complete records or Software Identifiers as appropriate. If the source's output is not 
	  in one of the data models identified in the Software Data Model IANA table (see <xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/>), 
	  the SW-PC MUST be capable of converting that output into one of the supported data models. In all cases, 
	  the SW-PC MUST also be capable of deriving a Software Identifier from the resulting record and also assigning 
	  that record a unique Record Identifier. The SW-PC
          MUST NOT provide any inventory or event information from software inventory sources for which it cannot
          provide this full support.</t>
          <t>When providing a SW Response (either in direct response to a SW Request or in fulfillment of a 
	  subscription) the SW-PC MUST include the
          complete set of relevant data from all supported sources of software inventory evidence. In
          other words, a full inventory is required to contain all records from all supported sources, a
          targeted inventory is required to contain all relevant records from all sources, and event tracking is
          required to cover all events from all sources. With regard to events, a SW-PC's assignment of
          EIDs MUST reflect the presence and order of all events on the endpoint (at least for supported
          sources) regardless of the source. This means that if source A experiences an event, and then source
          B experiences two events, and then source A experiences another two events, the SW-PC is
          required to capture five events with consecutive EID values reflecting the order in which the events
          occur.</t>
          <t>Note that, if a SW-PC collects data from multiple sources, it is possible that some software
          products might be "double counted". This can happen if both sources of inventory evidence provide a 
          record for a single installation of a software product. Moreover, each of these provided records might
          have different Software Identifiers. When a SW-PC reports information or
          records events from multiple inventory evidence sources, it MUST use the information those sources provide,
          rather than attempting to perform some form of reduction. In other words, if multiple sources report
          records corresponding to a single installation of a software product, all such records from
          each source are required to be part of the SW-PC's processing even if this might lead to multiple
          reporting, and the SW-PC is not to ignore some records to avoid such multiple reporting. Similarly, in
          the case that multiple sources report an event, the SW-PC MUST create separate event records
          with separate EIDs for each of these, even if there is the chance that they represent the two sources
          reporting the same action on the endpoint. Entities tracking software inventory information collected via SW-PCs and
          SW-PVs need to be aware that such double-reporting might occur. How (or if) such occurrences
          are detected and resolved is up to the implementers of those entities.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="Error-handling" title="Error Handling">
        <t>In the case where the SW-PC detects an error in a SW Request attribute that it receives it
          MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute with an error code appropriate to the nature of the error.
          (See Section 4.2.8 of PA-TNC <xref target="RFC5792"/> for more details about PA-TNC Error attributes and
          error codes as well as <xref target="PA-TNC-error-as-used-by-SW"/> in this specification for error codes 
	  specific to SW Attributes.)
          In the case that an error is detected in a SW Request the SW-PC MUST NOT take any action
          requested by this SW Request, even if partial completion of the SW is possible. 
	  In other words, a SW Request that contains an error is completely ignored by
          the SW-PC (beyond sending a PA-TNC Error attribute, and possibly logging the error locally) rather than 
	  being partially executed.</t>
          <t>In the case where the SW-PC receives a valid SW Request attribute but experiences an error
          during the process of responding to that attribute's instructions where that error prevents the SW-PC
          from properly or completely fulfilling that request, the SW-PC MUST send a PA-TNC Error
          attribute with an error code appropriate to the nature of the error. In the case where a PA-TNC Error
          attribute is sent, the SW-PC MUST NOT take any of the actions requested by the SW Request
          attribute which led to the detected error. This is the case even if some actions could have been completed
          successfully, and might even require the SW-PC to reverse some successful actions already
          taken before the error condition was detected. In other words, either all aspects of a SW Request
          complete fully and successfully (in which case the SW-PC sends a SW Response attribute), or
          no aspects of the SW Request occur (in which case the SW-PC sends a PA-TNC Error attribute).
          In the case that a SW-PC sends a PA-TNC Error attribute in response to a SW Request then the
          SW-PC MUST NOT also send any SW Response attribute in response to the same SW
          Request. For this reason, the sending of a SW Response attribute MUST be the last action taken
          by a SW-PC in response to a SW Request to avoid the possibility of a processing error occurring
          after that SW Response attribute is sent.</t>
          <t>In the case that the SW-PC detects an error that prevents it from properly or completely fulfilling
          its obligations under an active subscription, the SW-PC MUST send a PA-TNC Error attribute of type
          SW_SUBSCRIPTION_FULFILLMENT_ERROR to the SW-PV that established this
          subscription. This type of PA-TNC Error attribute identifies the specific subscription that cannot be
          adequately honored due to the error condition as well as an error "sub-type". The error sub-type is
          used to indicate the type of error condition the SW-PC experienced that prevented it from honoring
          the given subscription. In the case that the error condition cannot be identified or does not align with
          any of the defined error codes, the SW_ERROR error code SHOULD be used in the

          the associated subscription MUST be treated as cancelled by both the SW-PC and SW-PV.</t>
          <t>The SW-PV MUST NOT send any PA-TNC Error attributes to SW-PCs. In the case that a SW-PV
          detects an error condition, it SHOULD log this error but does not inform any SW-PC's of this
          event. Errors might include, but are not limited to, detection of malformed SW Response attributes
          sent from a given SW-PC, as well as detection of error conditions when the SW-PV processes
          SW Responses.</t>
          <t>Both SW-PCs and SW-PVs SHOULD log errors so that administrators can trace the causes of
          errors. Log messages SHOULD include the type of the error, the time it was detected, and additional
          descriptive information to aid in understanding the nature and cause of the error.</t>

    <section title="Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC Protocol">
      <t>This section describes the format and semantics of the Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC
        protocol. Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC uses the
        standard PA-TNC message header format. See the PA-TNC specification <xref target="RFC5792"/> for information on
        this header format. </t>
      <section anchor="PA-subtype-section" title="PA Subtype (AKA PA-TNC Component Type)">			
        <t>The NEA PB-TNC interface provides a general message-batching protocol capable of carrying one
          or more PA-TNC messages between the Posture Broker Client and Posture Broker Server. When PB-TNC is carrying a
          PA-TNC message, the PB-TNC message headers contain a 32 bit identifier called the PA Subtype.
          The PA Subtype field indicates the type of component associated with all of the PA-TNC attributes
          carried by the PB-TNC message. The core set of PA Subtypes is defined in the PA-TNC 
          specification. This specification adds the following
          enumeration element to the table in section 7.2 of the PA-TNC specification <xref target="RFC5792"/> using the
          IETF Standard name space (SMI Private Enterprise Number 0x000000):</t>

        <t>Each PA-TNC attribute described in this specification is intended to be sent between the SW-PC and
          SW-PV, so will be carried in a PB-TNC message indicating a PA Subtype of SW
          Attributes. Note that although the PA-TNC Error attribute is defined in the PA-TNC specification,
          when it is used in a SW Attribute exchange, it uses the SW Attributes Component Definition
          Value, as described in Section 4.2.8 of the PA-TNC 
          specification <xref target="RFC5792"/>. PB-TNC messages MUST always include the SW Attributes Subtype defined in
          this section when carrying SW Attributes over PA-TNC.</t>

        <t>A PA-TNC message is wrapped within a PB-TNC message. 
          A single PA-TNC message might contain one or more PA-TNC attributes.
          All of these attributes within a single PA-TNC message use the same PA Subtype value. As such, SW
          Attributes are never sent in the same PA-TNC message as attributes defined in other PA-TNC binding specifications. 
	  Note, however, that a single PB-TNC batch might contain multiple PB-TNC and PA-TNC
          messages, and each of those messages might use different PA Subtypes.</t>

        <t>The Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC protocol described in this specification is an extension
          of the PA-TNC protocol described in the NEA Architecture. PA-TNC was designed to be very
          flexible in order to carry many types of PA-TNC attributes that pertain to an enumerated set of
          component types (e.g. <xref target="PA-subtype"/>). PA-TNC attributes might be carried from Posture Collector to Posture 
	  Validator or vice versa and
          might carry information about endpoint state or other information to be sent between a Posture Validator and a
          Posture Collector. Therefore, the Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC specification defines a collection of PA-TNC
          attributes relevant to the collection and transmission of software inventories and associated events.</t>

          structure as described below. </t>

        <t>The attributes defined in this specification appear below with a short summary of their purposes. Each
          attribute is described in greater detail in subsequent sections.</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
          <t>SW Request - This attribute is used to request a software inventory or software event list from
          an endpoint. This attribute might also establish a subscription on the recipient SW-PC. A
          SW-PC MUST NOT send this attribute.</t>
          <t>Software Identifier Inventory - This attribute is used to convey an inventory expressed using
          Software Identifiers (instead of full records). When a SW-PC receives a SW Request
          attribute requesting an inventory using Software Identifiers, the SW-PC MUST send
          a Software Identifier Inventory attribute (or a PA-TNC Error) in response. This attribute also MAY
          be sent by the SW-PC in fulfillment of an active subscription. A SW-PV MUST NOT send
          this attribute.</t>
          <t>Software Identifier Events - This attribute is used to convey a list of events concerning changes
          to an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. Affected software inventory evidence records 
	  are indicated using Software
          Identifiers (instead of full records). When a SW-PC receives a SW Request attribute
          requesting an event collection using Software Identifiers, the SW-PC MUST
          send a Software Identifier Events attribute (or a PA-TNC Error) in response. This attribute also
          MAY be sent by the SW-PC in fulfillment of an active subscription. A SW-PV MUST NOT
          send this attribute.</t>
          <t>Software Inventory - This attribute is used to convey an inventory expressed using full software
	  inventory evidence records
          (instead of Software Identifiers). When a SW-PC receives a SW Request
          attribute requesting an inventory using full software inventory evidence records, the SW-PC MUST send a Software
          Inventory attribute (or a PA-TNC Error) in response. This attribute also MAY be sent by the SW-PC
          in fulfillment of an active subscription. A SW-PV MUST NOT send this attribute.</t>
          <t>Software Events - This attribute is used to convey a list of events concerning changes to an
          endpoint's inventory evidence collection. Affected software inventory evidence records are indicated using full records
          (instead of Software Identifiers). When a SW-PC receives a SW Request attribute
          requesting an event collection using full records, the SW-PC MUST send a Software
          Events attribute (or a PA-TNC Error) in response. This attribute also MAY be sent by the SW-PC
          in fulfillment of an active subscription. A SW-PV MUST NOT send this attribute.</t>
            <t>Subscription Status Request - This attribute is used to request a SW-PC send a summary
              of all the active subscriptions it has where the requesting party is the subscriber. The SW-PC
              MUST respond with a Subscription Status Response (or a PA-TNC Error). A SW-PC MUST NOT
              send this attribute.</t>
             <t>Subscription Status Response - This attribute is used to convey information about the active
              subscriptions that a SW-PC has for a given subscriber. A SW-PV MUST NOT send this
              attribute.</t>
              <t>PA-TNC Error - This is the standard PA-TNC Error attribute as defined in PA-TNC <xref target="RFC5792"/> and
              is used to indicate that an error was encountered during a SW Attribute exchange. It MUST be
              sent by a SW-PC in response to a SW Request in the case where the SW-PC
              encounters a fatal error (i.e., an error that prevents further processing of an exchange) relating
              to the attribute exchange. A SW-PV MUST NOT send this attribute. The SW-PC MUST
              then ignore the erroneous attribute after a PA-TNC Error attribute is sent (i.e., do not attempt to act
              on an attribute that generated a PA-TNC Error beyond sending the PA-TNC Error). In the case where
              the SW-PV experiences a fatal error, it MUST ignore the erroneous attribute without sending
              a PA-TNC Error attribute. It MAY take other actions in response to the error, such as logging the
              cause of the error, or even taking actions to isolate the endpoint</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Because one of the Software Identifier Inventory, Software Identifier Events, Software Inventory,
          or Software Events attributes is expected to be sent to a SW-PV in direct response to a SW
          Request attribute or in fulfillment of an active subscription, those four attribute types are
          referred to collectively in this document as "SW Response" attributes.</t>
          <t>All SW-PVs MUST be capable of sending SW Requests and be capable of receiving and
          processing all SW Response attributes as well as PA-TNC Error attributes. All SW-PCs MUST be
          capable of receiving and processing SW Requests and be capable of sending all types of SW
          Response attributes as well as PA-TNC Error attributes. In other words, both SW-PVs and SW-PCs
          are required to support their role in exchanges using any of the attribute types defined in this
          section. SW-PVs MUST ignore any SW Request attributes that they receive. SW-PCs MUST
          ignore any SW Response attributes or PA-TNC Error attributes that they receive. </t>

        <t>In this exchange, the SW-PV indicates to the SW-PC, via a SW Request, the nature of the
          information it wishes to receive (inventory vs. events, full or targeted) and how it wishes the returned
          inventory to be expressed (full records or Software Identifiers). The SW-PC responds with the
          requested information using the appropriate attribute type. A single SW Request MUST only lead
          to a single SW Response or PA-TNC Error that is in direct response to that request.</t>
          <t>In addition, if there is an active subscription on the endpoint, the SW-PC sends a SW Response
          to the SW-PV following a change event on the endpoint in fulfillment of that subscription. Such an

        <t>Note that, unlike direct responses to a SW Request, a single change event can precipitate multiple
          SW Responses for a single subscription, but only if all but the last of those SW Responses convey partial lists of event
          records, and the last of those SW Responses conveys a complete list of event records. (That is,
          the initial responses are partial lists and the last response is the remainder of the relevant event
          records, completing the delivery of all relevant events at the time of the change event.) A single
          Change Event MUST NOT be followed by multiple SW Response or PA-TNC Error attributes in any
          combination except as noted earlier in this paragraph.</t>
          <t>All SW-PVs and SW-PCs MUST support both types of exchanges. In particular, SW-PCs MUST be

      <section anchor="Request-ids" title="Request IDs">
        <t>All SW Request attributes MUST include a Request ID value. The Request ID field provides a value
          that identifies a given request relative to other requests between a SW-PV and the receiving
          SW-PC. Specifically, the SW-PV assigns each SW Request attribute a Request ID value
          that is intended to be unique within the lifetime of a given network connection ID as assigned by the
          SW-PV's Posture Broker Server. 
	  In the case where
          all possible Request ID values have been exhausted within the lifetime of a single network connection
          ID, the sender MAY reuse previously used Request IDs within the same network connection that are
          not being used as Subscription IDs. (See below in this section for an explanation of Subscription ID
          assignment.) In this case of Request ID reuse, Request IDs SHOULD be reused in the order of their
          original use. For example, if a Request ID of X was the first Request ID used within a particular
          network connection and if the Request IDs are exhausted, X will be the first reused Request ID. In
          other words, a SW-PC SHOULD NOT use a given Request ID value more than once within a
          persistent connection between a given Posture Broker Client-Posture Broker Server pair, 
	  but, in the case where reuse is necessary
          due to exhaustion of possible ID values, the SW-PC SHOULD structure the reuse to maximize
          the time between original and subsequent use. The Request ID value is included in a SW Response
          attribute directly responding to this SW Request to indicate which SW Request was received and
          caused the response. Request IDs can be randomly generated or sequential, as long as values are
          not repeated per the rules in this paragraph. SW-PCs are not required to check for duplicate
          Request IDs.</t>
          <t>In the case that a SW Request requests the establishment of a subscription and the receiving
          SW-PC agrees to that subscription, the Request ID of that SW Request (i.e., the establishing
          request of the subscription) becomes that subscription's Subscription ID. All attributes sent in
          fulfillment of this subscription include a flag indicating that the attribute fulfills a subscription and the
          subscription's Subscription ID. A SW-PV MUST NOT reuse a Request ID value in communicating
          to a given SW-PC while that Request ID is also serving as a Subscription ID for an active
          subscription with that SW-PC. In the case where a SW-PC receives a SW Request from a
          given SW-PV where that Request ID is also the Subscription ID of an active subscription with that
          SW-PV, the SW-PC MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute with an error code of
          SW_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_REUSE_ERROR. Note that this error does not cancel the
          indicated subscription.</t>
          <t>Subscription Status Requests and Subscription Status Responses do not include Request IDs.</t>

<texttable anchor="SW-request-attribute-fields" title="SW Request Attribute Fields">
  <ttcol>Field</ttcol>
  <ttcol>Description</ttcol>

  <c>Flags: Bit 0 - Clear Subscriptions</c>
  <c>If set (1), the SW-PC MUST delete all subscriptions established by the requesting SW-PV (barring any errors).</c>

  <c>Flags: Bit 1 - Subscribe</c>
  <c>If set (1), in addition to responding to the request as described, the SW-PC MUST establish 
  a subscription with parameters matching those in the request attribute (barring any errors).</c>
      
  <c>Flags: Bit 2 - Result Type</c>
  <c>If unset (0), the SW-PC's response MUST consist of complete software inventory evidence records and thus the response 
  MUST be a Software Inventory, a Software Events, or a PA-TNC Error attribute. If set (1), the response 
  MUST consist of Software Identifiers and thus the response MUST be a Software Identifier 
  Inventory, a Software Identifier Events, or a PA-TNC Error attribute.</c>

  <c>Flags: Bit 3-7 - Reserved</c>
  <c>Reserved for future use. This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon reception.</c>

  <c>Software Identifier Count</c>
  <c>A 3-byte unsigned integer indicating the number of Software Identifiers that follow. If this value 
    is non-zero, this is a targeted request, as described in <xref target="Targeted-requests"/>. 
    The Software Identifier Length and Software
    ID fields are repeated, in order, the number of times indicated in this field. In the case where Software 
    Identifiers are present, the SW-PC MUST only respond with software inventory evidence records or Software Identifiers that 
    correspond to the identifiers the SW-PV provided in this attribute (or with a PA-TNC Error attribute).
    This field value MAY be 0, in which case there are no instances of the Software Identifier Length 
    and Software ID fields. In this case, the SW-PV is indicating an 
    interest in all software inventory evidence records on the endpoint (i.e., this is not a targeted request).
  </c>

  <c>Request ID</c>
  <c>A value that uniquely identifies this SW Request from a particular SW-PV.</c>
  
  <c>Earliest EID</c>
  <c>In the case where the SW-PV is requesting software events, this field contains the EID value of the 
     earliest event the SW-PV wishes to have reported. (Note - the report will be inclusive of the event 
     with this EID value.) In the case where the SW-PV is requesting an inventory, then this field MUST be 
     0. (0x00000000) In the case where this field is non-zero, the SW-PV is requesting events and the SW-PC 
     MUST respond using a Software Events, Software Identifier Events, or a PA-TNC Error attribute. In the case 
     where this field is zero, the SW-PV is requesting an inventory and the SW-PC MUST respond using a 
     Software Inventory, a Software Identifier Inventory, or a PA-TNC Error attribute.</c>

   <c>Software Identifier Length</c>
   <c>A 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length in bytes of the Software ID field.</c>

   <c>Software ID</c>
   <c>A string containing the Software Identifier value from a software inventory evidence record. This field value MUST be 
     normalized to Network Unicode format, as described in <xref target="Normalize-text-encoding"/>. 
     This string MUST NOT be NULL terminated.</c>
</texttable>
        <t>The SW-PV sends the SW Request attribute to a SW-PC to request the indicated
          information. Note that between the Result Type flag and the Earliest EID field, the SW-PC is
          constrained to a single possible SW Response attribute type (or a PA-TNC Error attribute) in its
          response to the request.</t>
          <t>The Subscribe and Clear Subscription flags are used to manage subscriptions for the requesting
          SW-PV on the receiving SW-PC. Specifically, an attribute with the Subscribe flag set seeks to
          establish a new subscription by the requesting SW-PV to the given SW-PC, while an attribute
          with the Clear Subscription flag seeks to delete all existing subscriptions by the requesting SW-PV
          on the given SW-PC. Note that, in the latter case, only the subscriptions associated with the
          Connection ID and the Posture Validator ID of the requester are deleted as described in 
	  <xref target="Terminating-subscriptions"/>.
          A newly established subscription has the parameters outlined in the Request attribute. Specifically,
          the Result Type flag indicates the type of result to send in fulfillment of the subscription, the value of
          the Earliest EID field indicates whether the fulfillment attributes list inventories or events, and the
          fields describing Software Identifiers (if present) indicate if and how a subscription is targeted. In the case
          that the SW-PC is unable or unwilling to comply with the SW-PV's request to establish or clear
          subscriptions, the SW-PC MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute with the
          SW_SUBSCRIPTION_DENIED_ERROR error code. (Note that if the SW-PV
          requests that subscriptions be cleared but has no existing subscriptions, this is not an error.)</t>
          <t>An attribute requesting the establishment of a subscription is effectively doing double-duty, as it is a
          request for an immediate response from the SW-PC in addition to setting up the subscription. Assuming the
          SW-PC is willing to comply with the subscription it MUST send an appropriate response attribute to a 
	  request with the Subscribe flag set
          containing all requested information. The same is true of the Clear Subscription flag - assuming there is no error the SW-PC
          MUST generate a response attribute without regard to the presence of this flag in addition to clearing
          its subscription list.</t>
          <t>Both the Subscribe and Clear Subscription flags MAY be set in a single SW Request attribute. In
          the case where this request is successful, the end result MUST be equivalent to the SW-PC
          clearing its subscription list for the given SW-PV first and then creating a new subscription in
          accordance with the request parameters. (In other words, do not first create the new subscription and
          then clear all the subscriptions including the one that was just created.) In the case that the requested
          actions are successfully completed, the SW-PC MUST respond with a SW Response attribute.
          (The specific type of SW Response attribute depends on the Result Type and Earliest EID fields,
          as described above.) In the case where there is a failure that prevents some part this request from
          completing, the SW-PC MUST NOT add a new subscription, MUST NOT clear the old
          subscriptions, and the SW-PC MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute. In other words, the
          SW-PC MUST NOT partially succeed at implementing such a request; either both actions
          succeed, or neither succeed.</t>
          <t>The Earliest EID field is used to indicate whether the SW-PV is requesting an inventory or event
          list from the SW-PC. A value of 0 (0x00000000) represents a request for inventory information.
          Otherwise, the SW-PV is requesting event information. For Earliest EID values other than 0, the
          SW-PC's response MUST respond with event records, as described in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>. Note that the
          request does not identify a particular EID Epoch, since responses can only include events in the
          SW-PC's current EID Epoch.</t>
          <t>The Software Identifier Count indicates the number of Software Identifiers in the attribute. This number might be any
          value between 0 and 16,777,216, inclusive. A single Software Identifier is represented by fields: Software
	  Identifier Length and Software ID. The Software Identifier Length
          field indicates the number of bytes allocated to Software ID field. The Software Identifier field 
	  contains a Software Identifier as describe in <xref target="software-identifiers"/>. 
	  The presence of one or more Software Identifiers
          is used by the SW-PV to indicate a targeted request, which seeks only inventories of or events
          affecting software corresponding to the given identifiers. The SW-PC MUST only respond with
          records that match the Software Identifiers provided in the SW-PVs SW Request attribute.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Software Identifier Inventory">
        <t>A SW-PC sends this attribute to a SW-PV to convey the inventory of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
          expressed using Software Identifiers. This list might represent a complete inventory or a
          targeted list of records, depending on the parameters in the SW-PV's request. A SW-PV MUST
          NOT send this attribute. The SW-PC either sends this attribute in fulfillment of an existing
          subscription where the establishing request has a Result Type of 1 and the Earliest EID is zero, or in
          direct response to a SW Request attribute where the Result Type is 1 and the Earliest EID is zero.</t>

  <c>Software Identifier Count</c>
  <c>The number of Software Identifiers that follow. This field is an unsigned integer. The Data Model Type, 
  Software Identifier Length, SW ID, Record ID Length, and Record ID fields are repeated, in order, 
  the number of times indicated in this field. This field 
  value MAY be 0, in which case there are no instances of these fields.
  </c>

  <c>Request ID Copy / Subscription ID</c>
  <c>In the case where this attribute is in direct response to a SW Request attribute from a SW-PV, this 
  field MUST contain an exact copy of the Request ID field from that SW Request.
  In the case where this attribute is sent in fulfillment of an active subscription, this field MUST 
  contain the Subscription ID of the subscription being fulfilled by this attribute.</c>

  <c>EID Epoch</c>
  <c>The EID Epoch of the Last EID value. This field is an unsigned 4-byte integer.</c>

  <c>Last EID</c>

          response to a SW Request that establishes a subscription (i.e., a subscription's establishing
          request) MUST be treated as a direct response to that SW Request (and thus the Subscription
          Fulfillment bit is unset). SW Response attributes are only treated as being in fulfillment of a
          subscription (i.e., Subscription Fulfillment bit set) if they are sent following a change event, as shown

          at the time this inventory was collected. In the case where there are no recorded change events at
          the time that this inventory was collected, this field MUST contain 0. These fields can be interpreted

          Inventory attribute. The primary difference is that, instead of conveying an inventory using Software
          Identifiers, the attribute conveys zero or more event records, consisting of the EID, timestamp,
          action type, data model type, Software Identifier, and Record Identifier of the affected software inventory evidence record.</t>
          <t>With regard to the Timestamp field, it is important to note that clock skew between the SW-PC
          and SW-PV as well as between different SW-PCs within an enterprise might make correlation
          of timestamp values difficult. This specification does not attempt to resolve clock skew issues,
          although other mechanisms outside of this specification do exist to reduce the impact of clock skew
          and make the timestamp more useful for such correlation. Instead, Software Message and Attributes for
          PA-TNC uses Timestamp value primarily as a means to indicate the amount of time between two events
          on a single endpoint. For example, by taking the difference of the times for when a record was
          removed and then subsequently re-added, one can get an indication as to how long the system was
          without the given record (and, thus without the associated software). Since this will involve comparison
          of timestamp values all originating on the same system, clock skew between the SW-PC and
          SW-PV is not an issue. However, if the SW-PC's clock was adjusted between two recorded
          events, it is possible for such a calculation to lead to incorrect understandings of the temporal distance
          between events. Users of this field need to be aware of the possibility for such occurrences. In the
          case where the Timestamp values of two events appear to contradict the EID ordering of those events
          (i.e., the later EID has an earlier timestamp) the recipient MUST treat the EID ordering as correct.</t>
          <t>All event records in a Software Identifier Events Attribute are required to be part of the same EID Epoch.
          Specifically, all reported events MUST have an EID from the same EID Epoch as each other, and
          which is the same as the EID Epoch of the Last EID and Last Consulted EID values. The SW-PC
          MUST NOT report events with EIDs from different EID Epochs.</t>
          <t>The Last Consulted EID field contains the EID of the last event record considered for inclusion in this
          attribute. If this attribute contains a partial event set (as described in 
	  <xref target="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records"/>) this field value
          will differ from that of the Last EID field; if this attribute contains a complete event set, the Last EID
          and Last Consulted EID values are identical.</t>
          <t>If multiple events are sent in a Software Identifier Events attribute, the order in which they appear
          within the attribute is not significant. The EIDs associated with them are used for ordering the
          indicated events appropriately. Also note that a single Software Identifier might appear multiple
          times in an attribute, such as if multiple events involving the associated record were being reported.</t>

          subscription where the establishing request had a Result Type of 0 and the Earliest EID is zero, or in

	  <c>Event Count</c>
	  <c>The number of events being reported in this attribute. This field is a 3-byte unsigned integer. 
	  The EID, Timestamp, Action, Data Model Type, Record Identifier Length, Record Identifier, Record Length, and 
	  Record fields are repeated, 
	  in order, the number of times indicated in this field. (An instance of these fields is referred to

	  <c>Request ID Copy / Subscription ID</c>
	  <c>In the case where this attribute is in direct response to a SW Request attribute from a SW-PV, this

	  <c>EID Epoch</c>
	  <c>The EID Epoch of the Last EID value. This field is an unsigned 4-byte integer.</c>

	  <c>Last EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the last event recorded by the SW-PC, or 0 if the SW-PC has no recorded 
	  events. This field contains the EID of the SW-PC's last recorded change event (which might or 
	  might not be included as an event record in this attribute).</c>
  
	  <c>Last Consulted EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the last event record that was consulted when generating the event record list included 
	  in this attribute. This is different from the Last EID field value if and only if this attribute is 
	  conveying a partial list of event records. See <xref target="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records"/> 
	  for more on partial list of event records.</c>

	  <c>EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the event in this event record.</c>

	  <c>Timestamp</c>
	  <c>The timestamp associated with the event in this event record. This timestamp is the SW-PC's 
	  best understanding of when the given event occurred. Note that this timestamp might be an estimate.
	  The Timestamp date and time MUST be represented as an RFC 3339 [5] compliant ASCII string in Coordinated 
	  Universal Time (UTC) time with the additional restrictions that the 'T' delimiter and the 'Z' suffix MUST 
	  be capitalized and fractional seconds (time-secfrac) MUST NOT be included. This field conforms to the 
	  date-time ABNF production from section 5.6 of RFC 3339 <xref target="RFC3339"/> with the above restrictions. 
	  Leap seconds are 
	  permitted and SW-PVs MUST support them.
	  The Timestamp string MUST NOT be NULL terminated or padded in any way. The length of this field is always 20 octets.</c>

	  <c>Action</c>
	  <c>The type of event that is recorded in this event record. Possible values are: 1 = CREATION - the addition of a
	  record to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection; 2 = DELETION - the removal of a record
	  from the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection;
	  3 = ALTERATION - There was an alteration to a record within the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. All other values 
	  are reserved for future use and MUST NOT be used when sending attributes. In the case where a SW-PV 
	  receives an event record that uses an action value other than the ones defined here, it MUST ignore 
	  that event record but SHOULD process other event records in this attribute as normal.
	  </c>

	  <c>Data Model Type</c>
	  <c>A 1-byte unsigned integer containing an identifier number from the Software Data Model IANA table 
	  that identifies the data model of the reported record.</c>

	  <c>Record ID Length</c>
	  <c>A 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length in bytes of the Record ID field.</c>
	
	  <c>Record ID</c>
	  <c>A string containing the Record Identifier value from a software inventory evidence record. This field value MUST be normalized to 
	  Network Unicode format, as described in <xref target="Normalize-text-encoding"/>. This string MUST NOT be NULL terminated.</c>
	
	  <c>Record Len</c>
	  <c>This is a 4-byte unsigned integer indicating the length of the following record in bytes.</c>

	  <c>Record</c>
	  <c>A software inventory evidence record as a string. The record MUST be converted and normalized to

        <t>The fields of this attribute are used in the same way as the corresponding fields of the previous
          attributes. As with the Software Inventory attribute, a Software Events attribute can be quite large
          if many events have occurred following the event indicated by a request's Earliest EID. As such, it is
          recommended that the SW Request attributes only request full records be sent (Result Type set to 0)
          in a targeted request, thus constraining the response just to records that match a given set of Software
          Identifiers.</t>

	  <c>Reserved for future use. This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon reception.</c>

	  <c>Subscription Record Count</c>
	  <c>The number of subscription records that follow. This field is a 3-byte unsigned integer. 
	  The Flags, Software Identifier Count, Request ID, Earliest EID, Software Identifier Length, and Software ID 
	  fields are repeated, in order, the number of times indicated in 
	  this field. This field value MAY be 0 in which case there are no instances of these fields.</c>

	  <c>Flags, Software Identifier Count, Request ID, Earliest EID, Software Identifier Length, and 
	  Software ID</c>
	  <c>For each active subscription, these fields contain an exact copy of the fields with the same 
	  name as provided in the subscription's establishing request.</c>
	</texttable>
        <t>A Subscription Status Response contains zero or more subscription records. Specifically, it MUST
          contain one subscription record for each active subscription associated with the party that sent the
          Subscription Status Request to which this attribute is a response. As described 
	  in <xref target="Managing-subscriptions"/>, the
          SW-PC MUST use the requester's Connection ID and its Posture Validator ID to determine which
          subscriptions are associated with the requester.</t>
          <t>A SW-PC MUST send a Subscription Status Response attribute in response to a Subscription
          Status Request attribute. The only exception to this is if the SW-PC experiences an error condition
          that prevents it from correctly populating the Subscription Status Response attribute, in which case it
          MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute appropriate to the type of error experienced. If there are
          no active subscriptions associated with the requesting party, the Subscription Status Response
          attribute will consist of its Status Flags field, a Subscription Record Count field with a value of 0, and
          no additional fields.</t>
          <t>Each subscription record included in a Subscription Status Response attribute duplicates the fields
          of a SW Request attribute that was the establishing request of a subscription. Note that the Request
          ID field in the record captures the Subscription ID associated with the given subscription record (since
          the Subscription ID is the same as the Request ID of the establishing request). Note also that if the
          establishing request is targeted, then its Record Count field will be non-zero and, within that
          subscription record, the Record Namespace Length, Record Namespace, Record ID Length, and Record
          ID fields are repeated, in order, the number of times indicated in the Record Count field. As
          such, each subscription record can be different sizes. If the establishing request is not
          targeted (Record Count field is 0), the subscription record has no Record Namespace Length, Record Namespace,
          Record ID Length, or Record ID fields.</t>
          <t>When a SW-PV compares the information received in a Subscription Status Response to its own
          records of active subscriptions it should be aware that the SW-PC might be unable to distinguish
          this SW-PV from other SW-PVs on the same NEA Server. As a result, it is possible that the SW-PC
          will report more subscription records than the SW-PV recognizes. For this reason, SW-PVs
          SHOULD NOT automatically assume that extra subscriptions reported in a Subscription Status
          Response indicate a problem.</t>

        <t>The PA-TNC Error attribute is defined in the PA-TNC specification <xref target="RFC5792"/>, and its use here conforms

          <t>A PA-TNC Error attribute is sent instead of a SW Response attribute due to factors that prevent the
          reliable creation of a SW Response. As such, a SW-PC MUST NOT send both a PA-TNC Error
          attribute and a SW Response attribute in response to a single SW Request attribute.</t>
          <t><xref target="PA-TNC-error-codes-for-SW"/> lists the Error Code values for the PA-TNC Error 
	  attribute specific to the Software Message and
          Attributes for PA-TNC exchange. In all of these cases, the Error Code Vendor ID field MUST be set to
          0x000000, corresponding to the IETF SMI Private Enterprise Number. The Error Information
          structures for each error type are described in the following subsections.</t>
          <t>Note that a message with a Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC attribute might also result in an
          error condition covered by the Standard PA-TNC Error Codes defined in PA-TNC. For
          example, a SW Attribute might have an invalid parameter, leading to an error code of "Invalid
          Parameter". In this case, the SW-PC MUST use the appropriate PA-TNC Error Code value as defined
          in Section 4.2.8 of PA-TNC specification.</t>

    <section title="Supported Data Models">
      <t>Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC supports an extensible list of data models for representing 
      and transmitting software inventory information. This list of data models appears in the Software Data Model 
      IANA table (see <xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/>). This document provides guidance for an initial 
      set of data models. Other documents might provide guidance on the use of new data models by Software Message 
      and Attributes for PA-TNC, and will be referenced by extensions to the Software Data Model IANA table.</t>
      <section title="ISO 2015 SWID Tags using XML">
	<t>The International Organization for Standardization and the
	International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) published the
	specification governing SWID tag construction and use in 2009 with a revised version published in 2015.
	<xref target="SWID"/> Since that time, a growing number of vendors have integrated
	SWID tags into their software products.  Doing so significantly
	simplifies the task of identifying these pieces of software: instead
	of relying on discovery processes that look for clues as to software
	presence, such as the presence of particular files or registry keys,
	a readily available list of SWID tags provides simple and immediate
	evidence as to the presence of the given piece of software.</t>
	<t>SWID Message and Attributes for PA-TNC has no reliance on the presence or management of SWID tags 
	on an endpoint as described in the ISO specification. However, the data model for describing software 
	that is presented in the ISO specification provides a robust and comprehensive way of describing 
	software and is adopted here as a means of representing and transmitting software information. 
	It should be emphasized, the use of the ISO SWID tag data model makes no assumption as to whether 
	the source of the recorded information was, in fact, an ISO SWID tag harvested from the endpoint or 
	whether the information was created using some other source and normalized to the SWID format.</t>
	<section title="Guidance on Normalizing Source Data to ISO 2015 SWID Tags using XML">
	  <t>TBD</t>
	  <t>Don't violate the specification</t>
	  <t>Use your own Tag Creator RegID or the Unknown Tag Creator RegID. Do not use some other party's

      <section title="ISO 2009 SWID Tags using XML">
	<t>As noted above, ISO's SWID tag specification provides a useful data model for representation 
	of software information. As of the writing of this specification, while the 2015 specification 
	is considered more comprehensive and addresses some issues with the 2009 specification, 
	2009-format SWID tags remain far more common in deployments. For this reason, ISO 2009 SWID tags

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This section discusses some of the security threats facing Posture Collectors and Posture Validators that implement the Software
        Message and Attributes for PA-TNC protocol. This section primarily notes potential issues for
        implementers to consider, although it does contain a handful of normative requirements to address
        certain security issues. Implementers need to make the final decision as to how their implementations
        address the given issues. The issues identified below focus on capabilities specific to this document.
        Implementers are advised to consult other relevant NEA specifications
        for security issues that are applicable to such components in general.</t>
        <t>Reading the Security Considerations section of any well-written specification can be discouraging,
        as a long list of possible threats is catalogued. Keep in mind that no security measure is absolute,
        but each one can be beneficial. By understanding the weaknesses of each security measure, we can
        put in place countermeasures to protect against exploitation of these weaknesses.</t>
      <section title="Evidentiary Value of Software Inventory Evidence Records">
        <t>It must be remembered that the accuracy of an endpoints Software Inventory Evidence Collection
	  as an indicator of the endpoints software load and changes thereon is only as accurate as the
	  tools that populate and manage the software inventory evidence records in this collection. Some
	  tools might not be designed to update records in the Software Inventory Evidence Collection in
	  real time resulting in a collection that is out-of-step with actual system state. Moreover,
	  tools might inaccurately characterize software, or fail to properly record its removal. Finally,
	  it is likely that there will be software on the endpoint that is not tracked by any source and
	  thus is not reflected in the Software Inventory Evidence Collection. Users of collected software
	  inventory evidence records need to understand that the information provided by the Software
	  Message and Attributes for PA-TNC capability cannot be treated as completely accurate. Nonetheless,
	  having endpoints report this information can still provide useful insights into the state of the
	  endpoint's software load, and can alert administrators and policy tools of situations that
	  require remediation.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="Sensitivity-of-collected-tags" title="Sensitivity of Collected Records">
        <t>Software records on an endpoint are generally not considered to be sensitive, although there can be exceptions
          to this generalization as noted in the section on Privacy Considerations. In general, an endpoint's
          Software Inventory Evidence Collection can be browsed and individual records read by any party with access to the endpoint.
          This is generally not considered to be problematic, as those with access to the endpoint can usually
          learn of everything disclosed by that endpoint's records simply by inspecting other parts of the endpoint.</t>
        <t>The situation changes when an endpoint's inventory records are collected and stored off of the endpoint
          itself, such as on a NEA Server or CMDB. Inventory records represent a wealth of information about the endpoint in
          question and, for an adversary who does not already have access to the endpoint, a collection of the
          endpoint's inventory records might provide many details that are useful for mounting an attack. A list of the inventory records
          associated with an endpoint reveals a list of software installed on the endpoint. This list can be very
          detailed, noting specific versions and even patch levels, which an adversary can use to
          identify vulnerable software and design efficacious attacks.</t>
          <t>In addition, other information might also be gleaned from a collection of software inventory records:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>An inventory record might include information about where the product was installed on a given
              endpoint. This can reveal details about the file organization of that endpoint that an attacker
              can utilize.</t>
              <t>An inventory record might include information about how the software was provided to the endpoint,
              who in an organization signs off on the package release, and who packaged the product for
              installation. This information might be used as a starting point for the development of supply
              chain attacks.</t>
              <t>Events affecting inventory records are reported with timestamps indicating when each given event
              occurred. This can give the attacker an indication of how quickly an organization distributes
              patches and updates, helping the attacker determine how long an attack window might
              remain open.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Any consolidated software inventory is a potential risk, because such an inventory can provide an
          adversary an insight into the enterprise's configuration and management process. It is recommended
          that a centralized software inventory record collection be protected against unauthorized access. Mechanisms to
          accomplish this can include encrypting the data at rest, ensuring that access to the data is limited
          only to necessary individuals and processes, and other basic security precautions.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Integrity of Endpoint Records">
        <t>SW-PCs maintain records of detected changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. These
          records are used to respond to a SW-PV's request for change events. The SW-PV might use
          a list of reported events to update its understanding of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection without
          needing to receive a full inventory report from the SW-PC. For this reason, preserving the integrity
          of the SW-PC's record of events is extremely important. If an attacker modifies the SW-PC's
          record of changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection, this might cause the SW-PV's
          understanding of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection to differ from its actual state. Results might
          include leading the SW-PV to believe that absent software was present, that present software was
          absent, that patches have been installed even if this is not the case, or to be unaware of other
          changes to Software Inventory Evidence Records. As such, the SW-PC MUST take steps to protect the integrity of its event
          records.</t>
          <t>In addition, records of established SW-PV subscriptions also require protection against manipulation
          or corruption. If an attacker is able to modify or delete records of an established subscription by a
          SW-PV, the SW-PC might fail to correctly fulfill this subscription. The SW-PV would not be
          aware that its subscription was not being correctly fulfilled unless it received additional information
          that indicated a discrepancy. For example, the SW-PV might collect a full inventory and realize
          from this that certain events had not been correctly reported in accordance with an established
          subscription. For this reason, the SW-PC MUST protect the integrity of subscription records.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="SW-PC Access Permissions">
        <t>A SW-PC requires sufficient permissions to collect Software Inventory Evidence Records from all of its supported sources,
	  as well as sufficient permissions to interact with the
          endpoint's Posture Broker Client. With regard to the former, this might require permissions to read the contents of
          directories throughout the file system. Depending on the operating environment and other activities
          undertaken by a SW-PC (or software that incorporates a SW-PC as one of its capabilities)
          additional permissions might be required by the SW-PC software. The SW-PC SHOULD NOT
          be granted permissions beyond what it needs in order to fulfill its duties.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Sanitization of Record Fields">
        <t>Not all sources of software inventory evidence are necessarily tightly controlled. For example, consider a 
	  source that gathers .swid files from the endpoint's file system. Any party could create a new .swid file
	  that could be collected and turned into a Software Inventory Evidence Record. As a result, it is important
	  that the contents of source information not be automatically trusted. In particular, tools that read source
	  information and the Software Inventory Evidence Records derived therefrom, including SW-PCs,
          need to be careful to sanitize input to prevent buffer overflow attacks, encoding attacks, and other
          weaknesses that might be exploited by an adversary who can control the contents of a record.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="PA-TNC Security Threats">
        <t>In addition to the aforementioned considerations the Software Message and Attributes for PA-TNC protocol
          is subject to the same security threats as other PA-TNC transactions, as noted in Section 5.2 of PA-TNC
          <xref target="RFC5792"/>. These include, but are not limited to, attribute theft, message
          fabrication, attribute modification, attribute replay, attribute insertion, and denial of service.
          Implementers are advised to consult the PA-TNC specification to better understand these
          security issues.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>As noted in <xref target="Sensitivity-of-collected-tags"/>, if an adversary can gain an understanding 
        of the software installed on an
        endpoint, they can utilize this to launch attacks and maintain footholds on this endpoint. For this
        reason, the NEA Server needs to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to prevent exposure of collected
        inventory records. For similar reasons, it is advisable that an endpoint only send records to a NEA Server that is authorized
        to receive this information and that can be trusted to safeguard this information after collection.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="Relationship" title="Relationship to Other Specifications">
      <t>This specification makes frequent reference to and use of other specifications. This section
        describes these relationships.</t>
        <t>This specification is expected to participate in a standard NEA architecture. As such, it is expected
        to be used in conjunction with the other protocols used in a NEA exchange. 
	In particular, SW Attributes are conveyed over PB-TNC <xref target="RFC5793"/>,
        which is in turn conveyed over some variant of PT (either PT-TLS <xref target="RFC6876"/> or PT-EAP 
	<xref target="RFC7171"/>). 
	These protocols have an
        especially important role, as they are responsible for ensuring that attributes defined under this
        specification are delivered reliably, securely, and to the appropriate party.</t>
        <t>It is important to note that the Product Information, Numeric Version, and String Version attributes
        defined in the PA-TNC specification <xref target="RFC5792"/> are also meant to convey information about
        installed applications and the versions thereof. As such, there is some conceptual overlap between
        those attributes and the intent of this specification. However, PA-TNC was designed to
        respond to very specific queries about specific classes of products, while the Software Message and
        Attributes for PA-TNC specification is able to convey a broader query, resulting in a more
        comprehensive set of evidence regarding an endpoint's installed software. 
	As such, this specification provides important capabilities not
        present in the PA-TNC specification.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This section extends multiple existing IANA registries. Specifically, it
      extends the PA-TNC Attribute Types and PA-TNC Error Codes defined in the PA-TNC
      specification <xref target="RFC5792"/> and the PA-Subtypes registry defined in
      the PB-TNC specification <xref target="RFC5793"/> and extended in PA-TNC. This
      specification only adds values to these registries and does not alter how these
      registries work or are maintained. Consult the appropriate specifications for
      details on the operations and maintenance of these registries.</t>
      <section title="Registry for PA-TNC Attribute Types">
	<t><xref target="Section-SW-attribute-enum"/> of this specification defines several 
	new PA-TNC attributes. The following values are added to the registry for
	PA-TNC Attribute Types defined in the PA-TNC specification.
	Note that <xref target="SW-attribute-enumeration"/> in <xref target="Section-SW-attribute-enum"/>
	lists these attributes but uses a hexadecimal value to identify their associated integer. The
	integer values given in that table are identical to those provided here. Note also that
	<xref target="SW-attribute-enumeration"/> includes an entry for PA-TNC Error attributes, but
	the IANA information associated with that attribute is already defined in the PA-TNC specification and is
