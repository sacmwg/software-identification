    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>Knowing the list of the software installed on endpoints is
        useful to understand and maintain the security state of a
        network. For example, if an enterprise policy requires the
        presence of certain software and prohibits the
        presence of other software, reported software installation
        information can be used to indicate compliance and
        non-compliance with these requirements. When reported endpoint
        software installation inventory lists, shortened to "software
        inventories" for the remainder of this document, contain patch
        level data for identified software, further comparison to
        vulnerability or threat alerts can be used to determine an
        endpoint's exposure to attack. These are some of the highly
        useful management use cases supported by software inventory data
        provided by this specification.</t>

	  <t>There is a need for a standardized method for exchanging software
        inventory data that includes a unique software identifier
        associated with a specific version of a software product.
        In some cases, it may also be necessary to
        convey observable installation information and 
        characterization information for a software product
        including metadata about the product beyond its identifier.
        These "Messages and
        Attributes" enable software identification, installation, and
        characterization information to be provided for any software
        installed on any endpoint that supports this specification. Such
        information can come from multiple sources, including tag files
        (such as ISO SWID tags <xref target="SWID15"/>), reports from
        third party inventory tools, output from package managers, and
        other sources.</t>
	  <t>This specification is designed to only report software that is
        installed on an endpoint. In particular, it does not monitor or
        report information about what software is running on the
        endpoint. Likewise, it is not intended to report individual
        files, libraries, installation packages, or similar artifacts.
        While all of this information has its uses, this information
        requires different metadata and monitoring methods. As a result,
        this specification focuses solely on software inventory
        information, leaving reporting of other classes of endpoint
        information to other specifications. </t>
      
      <t>This specification defines a new set of PA-TNC
        attributes, which are used to
        communicate requests for software inventory information and software
        installation change events. The exchange of these messages allows
        software inventory information to be sent to a NEA Server, which
        can make this information available to other applications.</t>
      
      
          <section title="Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA)">
            <t>The Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) Working Group
          defines an open solution architecture that enables network
          operators to collect and utilize information about endpoint
          configuration and state. This information can be used to
          enforce policies, monitor endpoint health, and for many other
          activities. Information about the software present on an
          endpoint is an important consideration for such activities.
          The attributes defined in this document are used to
          communicate software inventory evidence, collected from a
          range of possible sources, from the posture collector on the
          endpoint to the posture validator on a NEA Server using the
          PA-TNC interface, as shown in <xref
            target="NEA-reference-model"/> below.</t>

        <t>This section defines terms with special meaning within this document.</t>
          <t>SW-PC - A Posture Collector (PC) that conforms to this specification. Note that
          such a posture collector might also support other PA-TNC exchanges beyond those defined herein.</t>
          <t>SW-PV - A Posture Validator (PV) that conforms to this specification. Note that
            such a posture verifier might also support other PA-TNC exchanges beyond those defined herein.</t>
	  <t>SW Attribute - This is a PA-TNC attribute (as defined in RFC 5792 <xref target="RFC5792"/> extension
	  for conveying software inventory information. This specification defines several new attribute types.</t>
          <t>Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection - The set of information regarding the set of 
	  software installed on an endpoint.
	  An endpoint's software inventory evidence 
	  collection might include information created by or derived from
          multiple sources, including but not limited to SWID tag files deposited on the file system during
          software installation, information generated to report output from software discovery tools, and information
	  dynamically generated by a software or package management system on an endpoint.</t>
	  <t>Software Inventory Evidence Record - The endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection is composed
	  of "records". Each record corresponds to one installed instance of a particular software product as reported by some
	  data source. It is
	  possible for a single installed instance to have multiple software inventory evidence records in an endpoint's
	  Software Inventory Evidence Collection - this can happen if multiple sources all report the same software
	  installation instance.</t>
	  <t>Software Identifier - A string associated with a specific version of a specific software product. 
	  Each supported SWIMA data model has its own rules for how a software 
	  identifier (see <xref target="software-identifiers"/>) is derived from the representation of the 
	  given software product using that data model,
	  and different sources for this information might populate relevant information differently. As such, 
	  while each software identifier uniquely identifies a specific software product, the same software product 
	  might be associated with multiple software identifiers reflecting differences between different data
	  sources and supported data models.</t>

    <section title="Background">
      <section anchor="supported-use-cases" title="Supported Use Cases">
        <t>This section describes the use cases supported by this
          specification. The primary use of exchanging software inventory information over the PA-TNC interface is to
          enable a challenger (e.g. NEA Server) to obtain inventory evidence about some system in a way that
          conforms to NEA procedures and expressed using a standard format.
          Collected software information can support a range of security activities including determining whether an
          endpoint is permitted to connect to the enterprise, determining which endpoints contain software that
          requires patching, and similar activities.</t>
        
        <section title="Use Software Inventory as an Access Control Factor">
          <t>Some enterprises might define security policies that
            require connected endpoints to have certain pieces of
            security software installed. By contrast, some security
            policies might prevent access to resources by endpoints that
            have certain prohibited pieces of software installed, since
            such applications might pose a security risk. To support
            such policies, the NEA Server needs to collect software
            inventory evidence from an endpoint that is seeking to
            initiate or continue connectivity to the enterprise
            resource.</t>
          <t>Based on this specification, the SW-PC can provide a
            complete or partial inventory to the SW-PV as required to
            determine policy compliance. The SW-PV can then use this as
            evidence of compliance or non-compliance to make a
            policy-based access decision.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Central Stores of Up-to-Date Endpoint Software Inventory Data">
          <t>Many tools use information about an endpoint's software
            inventory to monitor and enforce the security of a network.
            For example, a software patching tool needs to determine if there is
            out-of-date software installed that needs to be updated. A vulnerability
            management tool needs to identify endpoints with known
            vulnerable software installed (patched or otherwise) to gauge
            an endpoint's relative exposure to attack. A license management tool
            needs to verify that all installed software within the enterprise is accounted for. 
            A central repository representing an up-to-date
            understanding of each endpoint's software inventory
            facilitates these activities. Multiple tools can share such a repository 
            ensuring that software inventory
            information is collected more frequently and efficiently,
            leading to a more complete and consistent understanding of
            installed software state as compared to each tool collecting the
            same inventory information from endpoints individually.</t>
          <t>This specification supports these activities through a
            number of mechanisms. As noted above, a SW-PC can provide a
            complete list of software present in an endpoint's Software
            Inventory Evidence Collection to the SW-PV, which can then
            pass this information on to a central repository, such as a
            Configuration Management Database (CMDB) or similar
            application. In addition, SW-PCs are required to be able to
            monitor for changes to an endpoint's Software Inventory
            Evidence Collection in near real-time and immediately push
            reports of detected changes to the SW-PV. Thus any central
            repository fed by a SW-PV receiving inventory information
            can be updated quickly after a change occurs. Keeping a
            central repository synchronized with current software
            inventory information in this way allows tools to make
            efficient decisions based on up-to-date, consistent
            information.</t>

              Collection is populated. In particular, NEA components are
              not expected to perform software discovery activities
              beyond compiling information in an endpoint's Software
              Inventory Evidence Collection. This collection might come
              from multiple sources on the endpoint (e.g., information
              generated dynamically by package management tools or
              discovery tools, as well as SWID tag files discovered on
              the file system). While an enterprise might make use of
              software discovery capabilities to identify installed
              software, such capabilities are outside the scope of this
              specification.</t>

              software from a particular vendor is not supported. After
              the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection has
              been copied to some central location, such as the CMDB,
              processes there can perform queries based on any criteria
              present in the collected information, but this
              specification does not address using such queries to
              constrain the initial collection of this information from
              the endpoint.</t>
            <t>Use of properties of certain sources of software
              information that might facilitate local tests (i.e., on
              the endpoint) of endpoint state. For example, the optional
              package_footprint field of an ISO SWID tag can contain a
              list of files and hash values associated with the software
              indicated by the tag. Tools on the endpoint can use the
              values in this field to test for the presence of the
              indicated files. Successful evaluation of such tests leads
              to greater assurance that the indicated software is
              present on the endpoint. Currently, most SWID tag creators
              do not provide values for tag fields that support local
              testing. For this reason, the added complexity of
              supporting endpoint testing using these fields is out of
              scope for this specification, but may be considered in a
              future version.</t>

        <t>Below are the requirements that the Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC specification is required

            <t hangText="Efficient:">The NEA architecture enables delay of network access until the endpoint is determined not
            to pose a security threat to the network based on its asserted integrity information. To
            minimize user frustration, the Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC ought to minimize
            overhead delays and make PA-TNC communications as rapid and efficient as possible.</t>
            
            <t>Efficiency is also important when one considers that some network endpoints are small and
            low powered, some networks are low bandwidth and/or high latency, and some transport protocols
            (such as PT-EAP, Posture Transport (PT) Protocol for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) 
            Tunnel Methods <xref target="RFC7171"/>) or their underlying carrier protocol might allow
            only one packet in flight at a time or only one roundtrip. However, when the underlying PT
            protocol imposes fewer constraints on communications, this protocol ought to be capable of
            taking advantage of more robust communication channels (e.g. using larger messages or
            multiple roundtrips).</t>

            <t hangText="Scalable:">Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC needs to be usable in enterprises that contain tens

              points in time between the endpoint's first connection and the present. In such a scenario, it is necessary
              that any PC be able to report any changes to its software inventory evidence

          and reliably providing the reported Software Inventory Evidence Collection to the NEA Server. 
	  Similarly, this specification makes
          no assumption about the completeness of the Software Inventory Evidence Collection's coverage of the
          total set of software installed on the endpoint. It is possible, and even likely, that some

          <xref target="Security"/> for more on this security consideration.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="System Requirements">
      <t>The Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC specification facilitates the exchange of software
        inventory and event information. Specifically, each application supporting Software Inventory Message and
        Attributes for PA-TNC includes a component known as the SW-PC that receives messages sent with
        the SW Attributes component type. The SW-PC is also responsible for sending appropriate
        SW Attributes back to the SW-PV in response. This section outlines what
        software inventories and events are and the requirements
        on SW-PCs and SW-PVs in order to support the stated use cases of this specification.</t>
      <section title="Data Sources" anchor="information-sources">
	<t>The records in an endpoint's software inventory evidence collection come from one or more "sources". 
	A source represents one collection of software inventory information about the endpoint. Examples of 
	sources include, but are not limited to, ISO SWID tags deposited on the filesystem and collected 
	therefrom, information derived from package managers (e.g., RPM or YUM), and the output of software 
	inventory scanning tools. </t>
	<t>There is no expectation that any one source of inventory information will have either perfect 
	or complete software inventory information. For this reason, this specification supports the simultaneous 
	use of multiple sources of software inventory information. Each source might have its own "sphere of expertise"
	and report the software within that sphere. For example, a package manager would have excellent understanding 
	of the software that it managed, but would not necessarily have any information about software installed 
	via other means.</t>
	<t>A SW-PC is not required to utilize every possible source of software
	information on its endpoint. Some SW-PCs might be explicitly tied
	only to one or a handful of software inventory sources, or it could be designed to 
	dynamically accommodate new sources. For all
	software inventory evidence sources that a particular SW-PC supports,
	it MUST completely support all requirements of this specification
	with regard to those sources. A potential source that cannot support some set of required 
	functionality (e.g. it is unable to monitor the software it reports for change events, as discussed 
	in <xref target="Monitoring-changes-in-an-endpoint"/>) MUST NOT be used as a 
source of endpoint software inventory information, even 
	if it could provide some information. In other words, a source either supports full functionality 
	as described in this specification, or it cannot be used at all.</t>
	<t>When sending information about installed software the SW-PC MUST include
	the complete set of relevant data from all supported sources of
	software inventory evidence. In other words, sources need to be used consistently. This is 
	because, if a particular source is included in an initial inventory, but excluded from a 
	later inventory, the SW-PV receiving this information might reasonably conclude that the software 
	reported by that source was no longer installed on the endpoint. As such, it is important that 
	all supported sources be used every time the SW-PC provides information to a SW-PV.</t>
	<t>Note that, if a SW-PC collects data from multiple sources, it is
	possible that some software products might be "double counted".  This
	can happen if both sources of inventory evidence provide a record for
	a single installation of a software product.  When a SW-PC reports information or records
	events from multiple inventory evidence sources, it MUST use the
	information those sources provide, rather than attempting to perform
	some form of reduction.  In other words, if multiple sources report
	records corresponding to a single installation of a software product,
	all such records from each source are required to be part of the SW-
	PC's processing even if this might lead to multiple reporting, and
	the SW-PC is not to ignore some records to avoid such multiple
	reporting.</t>
	<t>All inventory records reported by a SW-PC include a Source Identifier linking them 
	to a particular source. Source Identifiers are discussed more in <xref target="source_identifiers"/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Data Models">
	<t>Software Inventory Message and Attributes supports an open set of data models by which installed 
	software instances can be described. This reflects the fact that, as of the writing of this 
	specification, no one software description data model has come to dominate use, and new models 
	are being developed regularly. As a result, information available to SW-PCs might come in a
	variety of formats, and a SW-PC could have little control over the format of the data it is
	able to collect.</t>
	<t>The format of the data model used to convey software inventory information had very little 
	impact on the behavior of the components defined in this specification. The SW-PV has no dependency 
	on the data model conveyed in SWIMA messages. For this reason, it MUST NOT reject a record or respond 
	with a PA-TNC Error due to the data model used in attributes it receives. (Note that the SW-PV might 
	serve as the front-end of other functionality that does have a dependency on the data model used to 
	express software information, but any such dependency is beyond the scope of this specification and 
	needs to be addressed outside the behaviors specified in this document. This specification is only 
	concerned with collection and delivery of software inventory information; components that consume 
	and use this information are a separate concern.)</t>
	<t>The SW-PC does have one functional dependency on the data models used in the software records it 
	delivers, but only insofar as it is required to deterministically create a Software Identifier (described in 
	<xref target="software-identifiers"/>) based on each record it delivers. The SW-PC MUST be able 
	to generate a Software Identifier for each record it delivers, and if the SW-PC cannot do so the 
	record cannot be delivered by the SW-PC. All SW-PCs MUST at least be able to generate Software Identifiers 
	for the data model types specified in <xref target="supported-data-models"/> of this document.
	A SW-PC MAY include the ability to generate Software Identifiers for other data model types, and thus 
	be able to support them as well.</t>

      <section anchor="Basic-exchange" title="Basic Attribute Exchange">
        <t>In the most basic exchange supported by this specification, a SW-PV sends a request to the

        <t>Upon receiving such a SW Request from the SW-PV, the SW-PC is expected to collect all 
	  the relevant software inventory
	  information from the endpoint's software evidence collection and place it within its
          response attribute.</t>
        <t>SW-PVs MUST discard without error any SW Response attributes that they receive for which
          they do not know the SW Request parameters that led to this SW Response. This is due to the
          fact that the SW Request includes parameters that control the nature of the response (as will be
          described in the following sections) and without knowing those parameters the SW Response
          cannot be reliably interpreted. Most often receiving an unsolicited SW Response attribute happens
          when a NEA Server has multiple SW-PVs; one SW-PV sends a SW Request but, unless exclusive
          delivery is used by the SW-PC in sending the response, both SW-PVs receive copies of the
          resulting SW Response. In this case, the SW-PV that didn't send the SW Request would lack
          the context necessary to correctly interpret the SW Response it received and would simply discard
          it. Note, however, that proprietary measures might allow a SW-PV to discover the SW Request
          parameters for a SW Response even if that SW-PV did not send the given SW Request. As
          such, there is no blanket requirement for a SW-PV to discard all SW Responses to SW
          Request the SW-PV did not generate itself, only that SW-PVs are required to discard SW
          Responses for which they cannot get the necessary context to interpret.</t>
        <t>In the case that it is possible to do so, the SW-PC SHOULD send its SW Response attribute to the
          SW-PV that requested it using exclusive delivery as described in section 4.5 of RFC 5793 
	  (PB-TNC) <xref target="RFC5793"/>. Exclusive delivery ensures that only the sender of the SW Request receives the
          resulting SW Response.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Core Software Reporting Information">
	<t>Different parameters in the SW Request can influence what information is returned in the SW 
	Response. However, while each SW Response provides different 
	additional information about this installed software, they all share a common set of fields that 
	support reliable software identification on an endpoint. These fields include: Software Identifiers, the Data Model Type,
	Record Identifiers, Software Locators, and Source Identifiers. These fields are present for each reported piece of 
	software in each type of SW Response. The following sections examine these three types of 
	information in more detail.
	</t>
	<section anchor="software-identifiers" title="Software Identifiers">
 	  <t>A Software Identifier uniquely identifies a specific version of a specific software product. 
	  The Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC specification does not dictate the structure of a 
	  Software Identifier (beyond stating that it is a string) or define how it is created. Instead, 
	  each data model described in the Software Data Model IANA table (<xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/>) 
	  includes its own rules for how a Software Identifier is created based on a record in the Endpoint's 
	  Software Inventory Evidence Collection expressed in that data model. Other data models will have their 
	  own procedures for the creation of associated Software Identifiers. Within the Software Inventory Message and 
	  Attributes for PA-TNC specification, the Software Identifier is simply an opaque string and there 
	  is never any need to unpack any information that might be part of that identifier.</t>
	  <t>A Software Identifier is a fraction 
	  of the size of the inventory record from which it is derived. For some combinations 
	  of data models and sources, the full record might never be necessary as the identifier can be 
	  directly correlated to the contents of the full record. This is possible with authoritative 
	  SWID tags, since these tags always have the same contents and thus a Software Identifier derived 
	  from these tags can be used as a lookup to a local copy of the full tag. For other combinations of 
	  source and data model, a server might not be able to determine the specific software product and 
	  version associated with the identifier without requesting delivery of the full record. However, even in 
	  those cases, downstream consumers of this information might never need the full record as long as 
	  the Software Identifiers they receive can be tracked reliably. 
	  A SW-PV can use Software Identifiers to track the presence of specific software products on 
	  an endpoint over time in a bandwidth-efficient manner.</t>
	  <t>There are two important limitations of Software Identifiers to keep in mind:
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>	The identifiers do not necessarily change when the associated record changes. In some 
	    situations, a record in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection will change 
	    due to new information becoming available or in order to correct prior errors in that information. 
	    Such changes might or might not result in changes to the Software Identifier, depending on the 
	    nature of the changes and the rules governing how Software Identifiers are derived from records 
	    of the appropriate data model. </t>
	    <t>It is possible that a single software product is installed on a single endpoint multiple times. 
	    If both of these installation instances are reported by the same source using the same data format, 
	    then this can result in identical Software Identifiers for each installation instances. In other 
	    words, Software Identifiers might not uniquely identify installation instances; they just are intended to uniquely 
	    identify software products (which might have more than one installation instance). Instead, 
	    to reliably distinguish between multiple instances of a single software product, one needs to make use 
	    of Record Identifiers, described in the following section.</t>
	  </list></t>
	</section>
	<section title="Data Model Type" anchor="data-model-type">
	  <t>The Data Model Type consists of two fields: the Data Model Type PEN and the Data Model Type. The combination
	  of these fields is used to identify the type of data model of the associated software inventory record.
	  The data model is significant not only because it informs the recipient of the data model
	  of the associated record, but because the Software Identifier of the record is derived directly from
	  the data recorded in that data model. As a result, Software Identifiers for the same software product
	  but expressed via different data models might be different. Clearly identifying the type of data
	  model from with the Software Identifier was derived thus provides useful context for that value.</t>
	  <t>The PEN (or Private Enterprise Number) identifies the organization that assigns meaning to the 
	  Data Model Type field value. PENs are managed by IANA in the Private Enterprise Numbers registry. 
	  PENs allow vendors to designate 
	  their own set of data models for software inventory description. IANA reserves the PEN of 0x000000. 
	  Data Model Types associated with this PEN are defined in the Software Data Model IANA table, created 
	  in <xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/> of this specification. Note that this IANA table reserves 
	  all values greater than or equal to 0xC0 (192) for enterprise use. This means that local enterprises can 
	  use custom data formats and indicate them with the IANA PEN and a Data Model Type value between 0xC0 and 
	  0XFF, inclusive. Those enterprises are responsible for configuring their SW-PCs to correctly report 
	  those custom data models.</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Record Identifiers" anchor="record_identifiers">
	  <t>A Record Identifier is a 4-byte integer generated by the SW-PC that is uniquely associated with a specific 
	  record within the Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. The SW-PC MUST assign a unique 
	  identifier to each record when it is added to the Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. 
	  The Record Identifier SHOULD remain unchanged if that record is modified. The SWID-PC might wish to 
	  assign Record Identifiers sequentially, but any scheme is acceptable provided that no two records receive 
	  the same identifier.</t>
	  <t>Servers can use Record Identifiers to distinguish between multiple instances of a single software 
	  product installed on an endpoint. Since each installation instance of a software product is associated 
	  with a separate record, servers can use the record identifier to distinguish between instances. For 
	  example, if an event is reported (as described in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>), the record 
	  identifier will allow the server to discern which instance of a software product is involved.</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Software Locators" anchor="software-locator">
	  <t>In addition to the need to identify software products, many use cases of inventory information 
	  need to know where software is located on the endpoint. This information might be needed to 
	  direct remediation actions or similar processes. For this reason, every reported software product 
	  also includes a Software Locator to identify where the software is installed on the endpoint.
	  </t>
	  <t>If the location is not provided directly by the record source the SW-PC is responsible for 
	  attempting to determine the location of the software product. The "location" of a product SHOULD 
	  be the directory in which the software products executables are kept. However, if that directory
	  is shared by other software products, the "location" SHOULD be the location of the primary executable 
	  associated with the software product. The source and/or SW-PC MUST be 
	  consistent in reporting the location of a software product (i.e., it cannot use the executable 
	  location in one report and the directory location in another).
	  </t>
	  <t>The location is expressed as a URI string consisting of a scheme and path. <xref target="RFC3986"/>
	  The location URI does not include an authority part. The URI schema describes the context of the 
	  described location. For example, in most cases the location of the installed software product 
	  will be expressed in terms of its path in the filesystem. For such locations, the location URI 
	  scheme MUST be "file". It is possible that other schemes could be used to represent other location 
	  contexts. Apart  from reserving the "file" and "unknown" (described below) scheme to indicate an 
	  installation location expressed using a path in the endpoint's file system, this specification 
	  does not reserve schemes. When representing software products in other location contexts, tools 
	  MUST be consistent in their use of schemes, but the exact string used in those schemes is not normatively defined here.
	  </t>
	  <t>It is possible, that a SW-PC is unable to determine the location of a reported software product. 
	  In this case, the SW-PC MUST assign that software product a location of "unknown:". (I.e., the "unknown" 
	  scheme and an empty path.) However, SW-PCs SHOULD only make such an assignment as a last resort. Even 
	  a probable location for a software product is preferable to using the unknown indicator.
	  </t>
	</section>
	<section title="Source Identifiers" anchor="source_identifiers">
	  <t>All SW-PCs MUST track the source of each piece of software information they report. Each 
	  time a SW-PC gets information to send to a given SW-PV from a new source (from the perspective 
	  of that SW-PV), the SW-PC MUST assign that source a Source Identification Number, which is an 
	  8-bit unsigned integer. Each item reported includes the Source Identification Number that provided 
	  that information. All information that is provided by 
	  that source, MUST be delivered with this same Source Identification Number. This MUST be done 
	  for each source used. If the SW-PC ever is unclear as to whether a given source is new or not, 
	  it MUST assume that this is a new source and assign it a new Source Identification Number. 
	  Source Identification Numbers can help with (although will not completely eliminate) the challenges 
	  posed by multiple reporting of a single software instance: since a single source would only report 
	  an instance or event once, if multiple reports of a similar instance come from multiple sources, 
	  this might be an instance of multiple reporting (although it still might not be so). On the other 
	  hand, if multiple instances are reported by a single source, this almost certainly means that 
	  there are actually multiple instance that are being legitimately reported.</t>
	  <t>The SW-PC is responsible for tracking associations between Source Identifiers and the given 
	  data source. This association MUST remain consistent with regard to a given SW-PV while there is 
	  an active PB-TNC session with that SW-PV. The SW-PC MAY have a different Source Identifier association 
	  for different SW-PVs. Likewise, the SW-PC MAY change the Source Identifier association for a given 
	  SW-PV if the PB-TNC session terminates. However, implementers of SW-PCs will probably find it easier 
	  to manage associations by maintaining the same association for all SW-PVs and across multiple sessions.</t>
	  <t>Of special note, events records reported from the SW-PC's event log (discussed in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>) 
	  also 
	  need to be sent with their associated data source. The Source Identifier reported with events MUST be 
	  the current (i.e., at the time the event is sent) Source Identifier associated with the data source 
	  that produced the event, regardless of how long ago that event occurred. Event logs are likely to 
	  persist far longer than a single PB-TNC session. SW-PCs MUST ensure that each event can be linked 
	  to the appropriate data source, even if the Source Identifiers used when the event was created have 
	  since been reassigned. In other words, when sending an event, it needs to be sent with the Source 
	  Identifier currently linked to the data source that produced it, regardless of whether a different 
	  Source Identifier would have been associated with the event when the event was first created.</t>
	  <t>Note that the Source Identification Number is primarily used to support recognition, rather than 
	  identification, of sources. That is to say, a Software Identification Number can tell a recipient 
	  that two events were reported by the same source, but will not necessarily help that recipient 
	  determine which source was used. Moreover, different SW-PCs will not necessarily use the same 
	  Source Identification Numbers for the same sources. SW-PCs MUST track the assignment of Source 
	  Identification Numbers to ensure consistent application thereof. SW-PCs MUST also track which Source 
	  Identification Numbers have been used with each SW-PV with which they communicate.</t>

          <t>A SW Attribute reporting an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection always contains the Software

          shown in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/> regardless of whether software inventory evidence records are included. 
	  The SW Request attribute indicates whether the response is required to include software inventory evidence records.

      <section anchor="Targeted-requests" title="Targeted Requests">
        <t>Sometimes a SW-PV does not require information about every piece of software on an endpoint but only needs
          to receive updates about certain software instances. For example, enterprise endpoints might be required to
	  have certain software products installed and to keep these updated. Instead of requesting a complete inventory 
	  just to see if these products are present, the SW-PV can make a "targeted request" for the software in question.</t>
          <t>Targeted requests follow the same attribute exchange described in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>. 
	  The SW-PV targets
          its request by providing one or more Software Identifiers in its SW Request attribute. The SW-PC
          MUST then limit its response to contain only records that match the indicated Software Identifier(s). This
          allows the network exchange to exclude information that is not relevant to a given policy question,
          thus reducing unnecessary bandwidth consumption. The SW-PC's response might or might not include software inventory
	  evidence records, depending on the parameters of the SW Request.</t>
          <t>Note that targeted requests identify the software relevant to the request only through Software 
          Identifiers. This specification does not support arbitrary, parameterized querying of
          records. For example, one cannot request all records from a certain software publisher, or all records created
          by a particular record source. Targeted requests only allow a requestor to request specific software (as
          identified by their Software Identifiers) and receive a response that is limited to the named software.</t>
	  <t>There is
          no assumption that a SW-PC will recognize "synonymous records" - that is, records from different sources
          for the same software. Recall that different sources and data models may use different Software Identifier 
	  strings for the same software product. The SW-PC returns only records that match the Software Identifiers
          in the SW Request, even if there might be other records in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
          for the same software product. This is necessary because SW-PCs might not have the ability to determine 
	  that two Software Identifiers refer to the same product.</t>
	  <t>Targeted requests do not include Record Identifiers or Software Locators. The response to a targeted request MUST 
	  include all records associated with the named Software Identifiers, including the case where 
	  there are multiple records associated with a single Software Identifier.</t>
          <t>SW-PCs MUST accept targeted requests and process them correctly as described above. SW-PVs
          MUST be capable of making targeted requests and processing the responses thereto.</t>

      <section anchor="Monitoring-changes-in-an-endpoint" 
	       title="Monitoring Changes in an Endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection">
        <t>The software collection on an endpoint is not static. As software is installed, uninstalled, patched, or
          updated, the Software Inventory Evidence Collection is expected to change to reflect the new software state on the
          endpoint. Different record sources might update the evidence collection at different rates. For example, a
	  package manager might update its records in the Software Inventory Evidence Collection immediately whenever
	  it is used to add or remove a software product. By contrast, sources that perform periodic examination of the
	  endpoint would likely only update their records in the Software Inventory Evidence Collection after each
	  examination.</t>
          <t>All SW-PCs MUST be able to be able to detect changes to the Software Inventory Evidence Collection. 
	  Specifically, SW-PCs MUST be able to detect:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The creation of records</t>
            <t>The deletion of records</t>
            <t>The alteration of records</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>An "alteration" is anything that modifies the contents of a record (or would modify it, if the record
          is dynamically generated on demand) in any way, regardless of whether the change is functionally
          meaningful. </t>
          <t>SW-PCs MUST detect such changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection in close to real-time
          (i.e., within seconds) when the Posture Collector is operating. In addition, in the case where there is a period during
          which the SW-PC is not operating, the SW-PC MUST be able to determine the net change to
          the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection over the period it was not operational. Specifically, the "net
          change" represents the difference between the state of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection when the
          SW-PC was last operational and monitoring its state, and the state of the endpoint's software inventory evidence
          collection when the SW-PC resumed operation. Note that a net change might not reflect the total
          number of change events over this interval. For example, if a record was altered three times
          during a period when the SW-PC was unable to monitor for changes, the net change of this interval
          might only note that there was an alteration to the record, but not how many individual alteration events
          occurred. It is sufficient for a SW-PC's determination of a net change to note that there was a
          difference between the earlier and current state rather than enumerating all the individual events that
          allowed the current state to be reached.</t>
          <t>The SW-PC MUST assign a time to each detected change in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection.
          These timestamps correspond to the SW-PC's best understanding as to when the detected
          change occurred. These timestamps MUST be as accurate as possible. For changes to the
          endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection that occur while the SW-PC is operating, the SW-PC ought to
          be able to assign a time to the event that is accurate to within a few seconds. For changes to the
          endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection that occur while the SW-PC is not operational, upon becoming
          operational the SW-PC needs to make a best guess as to the time of the relevant events (possibly
          by looking at timestamps on files), but these values might be off. In the case of dynamically
          generated records, the time of change is the time at which the data from which the records are
          generate changes, not the time at which a changed record is generated. For example, if records
          are dynamically generated based on data in an RPM database, the time of change would be
          when the RPM database changed.</t>
        <t>With regard to deletions of records, the SW-PC needs to detect the deletion and MUST retain
          a copy of the full deleted record along with the associated Record Identifier and Software Locator so that the record 
	  and associated information can 
	  be provided to the SW-PV upon request.
          This copy of the record MUST be retained for a reasonable amount of time. Vendors and
          administrators determine what "reasonable" means, but a copy of the record SHOULD be retained for
          as long as the event recording the deletion of the record remains in the SW-PC's event log (as 
	  described in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>). This is
          recommended because, as long as the event is in the SW-PC's change logs, the SW-PC might
          send an event attribute (described in <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>) that references this record, 
	  and a copy of the record is
          needed if the SW-PV wanted a full copy of the relevant records.</t>
          <t>With regard to alterations to a record, SW-PCs MUST detect any alterations to the contents
          of a record. Alterations need to be detected even if they have no functional impact on the record. A
          good guideline is that any alteration to a record that might change the value of a hash taken on the record's
          contents needs to be detected by the SW-PC. A SW-PC might be unable to distinguish
          modifications to the content of a record from modifications to the metadata the file system associates
          with the record. For example, a SW-PC might use the "last modification" timestamp as an
          indication of alteration to a given record, but a record's last modification time can change for reasons
          other than modifications to the record contents. A SW-PC is still considered compliant with this
          specification if it also reports metadata change events that do not change the record itself as
          alterations to the record. In other words, while SW-PC authors are encouraged to exclude
          modifications that do not affect the bytes within the record, discriminating between modifications 
	  to file contents and changes to file metadata can be
          difficult and time consuming on some systems. As such, as long as the alterations detected by a
          SW-PC always cover all modifications to the contents of record, the SW-PC is considered
          compliant even if it also registers alterations that do not modify the contents of a record as well. When
          recording an alteration to a record, the SW-PC is only required to note that an alteration occurred.
          The SW-PC is not required to note or record how the record altered, nor is it possible to include
          such details in SW Attributes reporting the change to a SW-PV. There is no need to retain a copy of the original record.</t>
	  <t>When a record changes it SHOULD retain the same Record Identifier. The Software Locator might or 
	  might not change, depending on whether the software changed locations during the changes that led 
	  to the record change. A record change MUST retain the same Software Identifier. This means that any 
	  action that changes a software product (e.g., application of a patch that results in a change to 
	  the product's version) MUST NOT be reflected by a record change but instead MUST result in the 
	  deletion of the old record and the creation of a new record. This reflects the requirement that a 
	  record in the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection correspond directly with an 
	  instance of a specific software product.

      <section anchor="Reporting-change-events" title="Reporting Change Events">
        <t>As noted in the preceding section, SW-PCs MUST be able to detect changes to the endpoints Software Inventory
          Evidence Collection (creation, deletion, and alteration) in near real-time while the SW-PC is
          operational, and MUST be able to account for any net change to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
          that occurs when the SW-PC is not operational. However, to be of use to the enterprise, the NEA Server
          needs to be able to receive these events and be able to understand how new changes relate to earlier
          changes. In Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC, this is facilitated by reporting change events. All
          SW-PCs MUST be capable of receiving requests for change events and sending change event
          attributes. All SW-PVs MUST be capable of requesting and receiving change event attributes.</t>
        <section anchor="Change-event-records" title="Event Identifiers">
          <t>To be useful, change events need to be correctly ordered. Ordering of events is 
	  facilitated by two pieces of information: an Event Identifier (EID) value and an EID Epoch value.</t>
          <t>An EID is a 4-byte unsigned integer that the SW-PC assigns sequentially to each observed event
            (whether detected in real-time or deduced by looking for net changes over a period of SW-PC
            inactivity). All EIDs exist within the context of some "EID Epoch", which is also represented as a
            4-byte unsigned integer. EID Epochs are used to ensure synchronization between the SW-PC and
            any SW-PVs with which it communicates. EID Epoch values SHOULD be generated randomly
            and in such a way that it is unlikely that the same EID Epoch is generated twice, even if the SW-PC
            reverted to an earlier state (e.g., resetting it to factory defaults). In the case where a SW-PC
            needs to reset its EID counter, either because it has exhausted all available EID values or because
            the SW-PC's event log becomes corrupted, then a new EID Epoch MUST be selected.</t>
          <t>Within an Epoch, EIDs MUST be assigned sequentially, so that if a particular event is assigned an
            EID of N, the next observed event is given an EID of N+1. In some cases, events might occur
            simultaneously, or the SW-PC might not otherwise be able to determine an ordering for events.
            In these cases, the SW-PC creates an arbitrary ordering of the events and assigns EIDs according
            to this ordering. Two change events MUST NOT ever be assigned the same EID within the same EID
            Epoch. No meaningful comparison can be made between EID values of different Epochs.</t>
            <t>The EID value of 0 is reserved and MUST NOT be associated with any event. Specifically, an EID of
            0 in a SW Request attribute indicates that a SW-PV wants an inventory response rather than
            an event response, while an EID of 0 in a SW Response is used to indicate the initial state of the
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection prior to the observation of any events. Thus the very first recorded
            event in a SW-PC's records within an EID Epoch MUST be assigned a value of 1 or greater.
            Note that EID and EID Epoch values are assigned by the SW-PC without regard to whether events
            are being reported to one or more SW-PVs. The SW-PC records events and assigns EIDs
            during its operation. Any and all SW-PVs that request event information from the SW-PC will
            have those requests served from the same event records and thus will see the same EIDs and EID Epochs
            for the same events.</t>
	    <t>If a SW-PC uses multiple sources, a SW-PC's assignment of EIDs
	    MUST reflect the presence and order of all events on the endpoint (at
	    least for supported sources) regardless of the source.  This means
	    that if source A experiences an event, and then source B experiences
	    two events, and then source A experiences another two events, the SW-
	    PC is required to capture five events with consecutive EID values
	    reflecting the order in which the events occur.</t>
            <t>The SW-PC MUST ensure there is no coverage gap (i.e., change events that are not recorded in
            the SW-PC's records) in its change event records. This is necessary because a coverage gap
            might give a SW-PV a false impression of the endpoint's state. For example, if a SW-PV saw
            an event indicating that a particular record had been added to the endpoint's software inventory
	    evidence collection, and saw no subsequent events
            indicating that record had been deleted, it might reasonably assume that this record was still present
	    and thus that the indicated software was still installed
            (assuming the Epoch has not changed). If there is a coverage gap in the SW-PC's event records,
            however, this assumption could be false. For this reason, the SW-PC's event records MUST NOT contain
            gaps. In the case where there are periods where it is possible that changes occurred without the
            SW-PC detecting or recording them, the SW-PC MUST either compute a net change and
            update its event records appropriately, or pick a new EID Epoch to indicate a discontinuity with previous
            event records.</t>
            <t>Within a given Epoch, once a particular event has been assigned an EID, this association MUST
            NOT be changed. That is, within an Epoch, once an EID is assigned to an event, that EID cannot be
            reassigned to a different event, and the event cannot be assigned a different EID. When the SW-PC's
            Epoch changes, all of these associations between EIDs and events are cancelled, and EID
            values once again become free for assignment.</t>
        </section>
	<section title="Core Event Tracking Information">
	  <t>Whether reporting events or full inventories it is important to know how the reported information 
	  fits into the overall timeline of change events. This is why all SW Response attributes include fields 
	  to place that response within the sequence of detected events. Specifically, all SW Responses include 
	  a Last EID and EID Epoch field. The EID Epoch field identifies the EID Epoch in which the SW Response 
	  was sent. If the SW Response is reporting events, all reported events occurred within the named EID Epoch. 
	  The Last EID (which is also always from the named EID Epoch) indicates the EID of the last recorded change 
	  event at the time that the SW Response was sent. These two fields allow any response to be placed in the 
	  context of the complete set of detected change events within a given EID Epoch.
	  </t>
	</section>
        <section title="Updating Inventory Knowledge Based on Events">
          <t>Modern endpoints can have hundreds of software products installed, most of which are unlikely to
            change from one day to the next. As such, instead of exchanging a complete list of an endpoint's
            inventory on a regular basis, one might wish to only identify changes since some earlier known state
            of this inventory. This is readily facilitated by the use of EIDs to place change events in a context
            relative to earlier state.</t>
            <t>As noted above, every SW Response sent by a SW-PC to a SW-PV (as described in <xref target="Basic-exchange"/> through 
	    <xref target="Targeted-requests"/>)
            includes the EID Epoch and EID of the last event recorded prior to that response being compiled.
            This allows the SW-PV to place all subsequently received event records in context relative to this
            SW Response attribute (since the EIDs represent a total ordering of all changes to the endpoint's software inventory evidence
            collection). Specifically, a SW-PV (or, more likely, a database that collects and records its findings)
            can record an endpoint's full inventory and also the EID and Epoch of the most recent event reflected
            at the time of that inventory. From that point on, if change events are observed, the attribute describing these events
            indicates the nature of the change, the affected records, and the order in which these events
            occurred (as indicated by the sequential EIDs). Using this information, any remote record of the
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection can be updated appropriately.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Using-event-records-in-SW-attributes" title="Using Event Records in SW Attributes">
          <t>A SW-PV MUST be able to request a list of event records instead of an inventory. The attribute
            flow in such an exchange looks the same as the basic flow shown in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>. 
	    The only difference is
            that, in the SW Request attribute, the SW-PV provides an EID other than 0. (A value of 0 in
            these fields represents a request for an inventory.) When the SW-PC receives such a request,
            instead of identifying records from the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection, it consults its list of
            detected changes. The SW-PC MUST add an event record to the SW Response attribute for
            each recorded change event with an EID greater than or equal to the EID in the SW Request
            attribute (although targeting of requests, as described in the next paragraph, might limit this list). A list
            of event records MUST only contain events with EIDs that all come from the current Epoch.</t>
            <t>SW-PVs can target requests for event records by including one or more Software Identifiers, as
            described in <xref target="Targeted-requests"/>, in the SW Request that requests an event record list. 
	    A targeted request
            for event records is used to indicate that only events affecting software that matches one of the provided
            Software Identifiers are to be returned. Specifically, in response to a targeted request for event
            records, the SW-PC MUST exclude any event records that are less than the indicated EID (within
            the current EID Epoch) and exclude any event records where the affected software does not match
            one of the provided Software Identifiers. This might mean that the resulting list of event records sent
            in the response attribute does not provide a continuous sequence of EIDs. Both SW-PCs and
            SWIC-PVs MUST support targeted request for event records.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records" 
		 title="Partial and Complete Lists of Event Records in SW Attributes">
          <t>Over time, a SW-PC might record a large number of change events. If a SW-PV requests all
            change events covering a large period of time, the resulting SW Response attribute might be
            extremely large, especially if the SW-PV requests inclusion of software inventory evidence records in the response. 
	    In the case that the resulting attribute is
            too large to send (either because it exceeds the 4GB attribute size limit imposed by the PA-TNC 
            specification, or because it exceeds some smaller size limit imposed on the SW-PC) the
            SW-PC MAY send a partial list of event records back to the SW-PV.</t>
            <t>Generation of a partial list of events in a SW Response attribute requires the SW-PC to identify
            a "consulted range" of EIDs. A consulted range is the set of event records that are examined for
            inclusion in the SW Response attribute and that are included in that attribute if applicable. Recall
            that, if a SW Request is targeted, only event records that involve the indicated software would
            be applicable. (See <xref target="Targeted-requests"/> for more on Targeted Request.) 
	    If a request is not targeted, all event
            records in the considered range are applicable and included in the SW Response attribute.</t>
            <t>The lower bound of the consulted range MUST be the EID provided in the SW Request. (Recall
            that a SW Request indicates a request for event records by providing a non-0 EID value in the
            SW Request. See <xref target="Using-event-records-in-SW-attributes"/>.) 
	    The upper bound of the consulted range is the EID of the latest
            event record (as ordered by EID values) that is included in the SW Response attribute if it is
            applicable to the request. The EID of this last event record is called the "Last Consulted EID". The
            SW-PC chooses this Last Consulted EID based on the size of the event record list it is willing to
            provide to the SW-PV.</t>
            <t>A partial result list MUST include all applicable event records within the consulted range. This means
            that for any applicable event record (i.e., any event record in an un-targeted request, or any event record
	    associated with software matching a requested Software Identifier in a targeted request)
	    whose EID is greater than or equal to the EID provided in the
            SW Request and whose EID is less than or equal to the Last Consulted EID, that event record
            MUST be included in the SW Response conveying this partial list of event records. This ensures
            that every partial list of event records is always complete within its indicated range.</t>
            <t>All SW Response attributes that convey event records include a Last Consulted EID field. This is in addition
	    to the EID Epoch and Last EID fields that are present in all SW Responses. Note that, if
            responding to a targeted SW Request, the SW Response attribute might not contain the event
            record whose EID matches the Last Consulted EID value. For example, the last consulted EID record
            might have been deemed inapplicable because it did not match the specified list of Software
            Identifiers in the SW Request.</t>
            <t>If a SW-PV receives a SW Response attribute where the Last EID and Last Consulted EID
            fields are identical, the SW-PV knows that it has received a result list that is complete, given the
            parameters of the request, up to the present time. 
	    </t>
	    <t>On the other hand, if the Last EID is greater than the Last
            Consulted EID, the SW-PV has received a partial result list. (The Last Consulted EID MUST NOT
	    exceed the Last EID.) In this case, if the
            SW-PV wishes to try to collect the rest of the partially delivered result list it then sends a new
            SW Request whose EID is one greater than the Last Consulted EID in the preceding response.
            Doing this causes the SW-PC to generate another SW Response attribute containing event
            records where the earliest reported event record is the one immediately after the event record with
            the Last Consulted EID (since EIDs are assigned sequentially). By repeating this process until it
            receives a SW Response where the Last EID and Last Consulted EID are equal, the SW-PV is
            able to collect all event records over a given range, even if the complete set of event records would
            be too large to deliver via a single attribute.</t>
            <t>Implementers need to be aware that a SW Request might specify an EID that is greater than the
            EID of the last event recorded by a SW-PC. In accordance with the behaviors described in 
	    <xref target="Using-event-records-in-SW-attributes"/>,
            a SW-PC MUST respond to such a request with a SW Response attribute that contains zero event records. 
	    This is because the SW-PC has recorded no event records with
            EIDs greater than or equal to the EID in the SW Request. In such a case, the Last Consulted EID
            field MUST be set to the same value as the Last EID field in this SW Response attribute. This case
            is called out because the consulted range on a SW-PC in such a situation is a negative range, where
            the "first" EID in the range (provided in the SW Request) is greater than the "last" EID in the range
            (this being the EID of the last recorded event on the SW-PC). Implementers need to ensure that
            SW-PCs do not experience problems in such a circumstance.</t>
            <t>Note that this specification only supports the returning of partial results when returning event records.
            There is no way to return a partial inventory list under this specification.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Synchronizing-event-identifiers-and-epochs" title="Synchronizing Event Identifiers and Epochs">
          <t>Since EIDs are sequential within an Epoch, if a SW-PV's list of event records contains gaps in the
            EID values within a single Epoch, the SW-PV knows that there are events that have not been
            accounted for. The SW-PV can either request a new event list to collect the missing events or
            request a full inventory to re-sync its understanding of the state of the endpoint's Software Inventory
	    Evidence Collection. In
            either case, after the SW-PV's record of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection has been updated,
            the SW-PV can record the new latest EID value and track events normally from that point on.</t>
            <t>If the SW-PV receives any attribute from a SW-PC where the EID Epoch differs from the EID
            Epoch that was used previously, then SW-PV or any entity using this information to track the
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection knows that there is a discontinuity in their understanding of the
            endpoint's state. To move past this discontinuity and reestablish a current understanding of the state
            of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection, the SW-PV needs to receive a full inventory from the
            endpoint. The SW-PV cannot be brought in sync with the endpoint's state through the collection of any
	    set of event records in this situation.
	    This is because it is not possible to account for all events on the SW-PC
            since the previous Epoch was used, because there is no way to query for EIDs from a previous
            Epoch. Once the SW-PV has received a full inventory for the new Epoch, the SW-PV records
            the latest EID reported in this new Epoch and can track further events normally.</t>
            <t>A SW-PC MUST NOT report events with EIDs from any Epoch other than the current EID Epoch.
            The SW-PC MAY choose to purge all event records from a previous Epoch from memory after an
            Epoch change. Alternately, the SW-PC MAY choose to retain some event records from a previous
            EID Epoch and assign them new EIDs in the current Epoch. However, in the case where a SW-PC
            chooses the latter option it MUST ensure that the order of events according to their EIDs is
            unchanged and that there is no coverage gap between the first retained event recorded during the
            previous Epoch (now reassigned with an EID in the current Epoch) and the first event recorded during
            the current Epoch. In particular, the SW-PC MUST ensure that all change events that occurred
            after the last recorded event from the previous Epoch are known and recorded. (This might not be
            possible if the Epoch change is due to state corruption on the SW-PC.) A SW-PC might choose
            to reassign EIDs to records from a preceding Epoch to create a "sliding window" of events, where
            each Epoch change represents a shift in the window of available events.</t>
            <t>In the case where a SW-PC suffers a crash and loses track of its current EID Epoch or current
            EID, then it MUST generate a new EID Epoch value and begin assigning EIDs within that Epoch. In
            this case, the SW-PC MUST purge all event records from before the crash as it cannot ensure
            that there is not a gap between the last of those records and the next detected event. The process
            for generating a new EID Epoch MUST minimize the possibility that the newly generated EID Epoch
            is the same as a previously used EID Epoch.</t>
            <t>The SW-PV will normally never receive an attribute indicating that the latest EID is less than the
            latest EID reported in a previous attribute within the same EID Epoch. If this occurs, the SW-PC
            has suffered an error of some kind, possibly indicative of at least partial corruption of its event log. In
            this case, the SW-PV SHOULD treat the situation as if there was a change in Epoch and treat any
            local copy of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection as out-of-sync until a full inventory can be reported
            by the SW-PC. In this case, the SW-PV SHOULD flag the occurrence so the SW-PC can be examined to
            ensure it is now operating properly.</t>

     <section anchor="subscriptions" title="Subscriptions">
        <t>Thus far, all attribute exchanges discussed assume that a SW-PV sent an SW Request
          attribute and the SW-PC is providing a direct response to that request. The Software Inventory Message and
          Attributes for PA-TNC specification also supports the ability for a SW-PC to send a SW Response
	  to the SW-PV in response to observed changes in the endpoint's software inventory evidence
          collection, instead of in direct response to a SW Request. An agreement by a SW-PC to send
          content when certain changes are detected to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection is referred to in this
          specification as a "subscription", and the SW-PV that receives this content is said to be
          "subscribed to" the given SW-PC. All SW-PCs and SW-PVs MUST support the use of
          subscriptions.</t>
        <section title="Establishing Subscriptions">
          <t>A SW-PV establishes a subscription on a particular SW-PC by sending a SW Request
            attribute with the Subscription flag set. The SW Request attribute is otherwise identical to the SW
            Requests discussed in previous sections. Specifically, such a SW Request might or might not 
	    request inclusion of software inventory evidence records,
            might or might not be targeted, and might request change event records or endpoint
            inventory. Assuming no error is encountered, a SW-PC MUST send a SW Response attribute
            in direct response to this SW Request attribute, just as if the Subscription flag was not set. As such,
            the attribute exchange that establishes a new subscription in a SW-PC has the same flow seen
            in the previous attribute exchanges, as depicted in <xref target="Basic-sw-message-exchange"/>. 
	    If the SW-PV does not receive a
            PA-TNC Error attribute (as described in <xref target="Error-handling"/> and 
            <xref target="SW-PA-TNC-error"/>) 
	    in response to their subscription request,
            the subscription has been successfully established on the SW-PC. The SW Request attribute
            that establishes a new subscription is referred to as the "establishing request" for that subscription.</t>
            <t>When a subscription is established it is assigned a Subscription ID value. The Subscription ID is
            equal to the value of the Request ID of the establishing request. (For more about Request IDs, see
            <xref target="Request-ids"/>.)</t>
            <t>A SW-PC MUST have the ability to record and support multiple simultaneous subscriptions from
            a single party and from multiple parties. A SW-PV MUST have the ability to record
            and support multiple simultaneous subscriptions to a single party and subscriptions to multiple
            parties.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Managing-subscriptions" title="Managing Subscriptions">
          <t>The SW-PC MUST record each accepted subscription along with the identity of the party to whom
            attributes are to be pushed in compliance with the subscription. This identity includes both the 
	    NEA Server's connection ID and the Posture Validator Identifier from the PB-PA message that delivered
	    the request. </t>
            <t>Likewise, SW-PVs MUST record each accepted subscription for which they are the subscribing
            party along with the associated Subscription ID and the identity of the SW-PC that will be fulfilling the
            subscription. The SW-PV needs to retain this information in order to correctly interpret pushed
            SW Response attributes sent in fulfillment of the subscription. The identity of the SW-PC is
	    given in the Posture Collector Identifier of the PB-PA message header in all messages from
	    that SW-PC.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="Terminating-subscriptions" title="Terminating Subscriptions">
          <t>Subscriptions MAY be terminated at any time by the subscribing SW-PV by setting the Clear
            Subscriptions flag in a SW Request. (See <xref target="SW-request"/> for more on using this flag.) In the case that
	    a SW Request with the Clear Subscriptions flag set is received the SW-PC MUST only clear subscriptions that
            match both the NEA server connection ID and the SW-PV ID for this SW Request, 
	    and MUST clear all such subscriptions. </t>
            <t>This specification does not give the SW-PV the ability to terminate subscriptions individually - all
            subscriptions to the SW-PV are cleared when the Clear Subscriptions flag is set.</t>
            <t>This specification does not give the SW-PC the ability to unilaterally terminate a subscription.
            However, if the SW-PC experiences a fatal error fulfilling a subscription, resulting in sending a
            PA-TNC Error attribute of type SW_SUBSCRIPTION_FULFILLMENT_ERROR, then the
            subscription whose fulfillment led to the error MUST be treated as terminated by both the SW-PC
            and the SW-PV. Only the subscription experiencing the error is cancelled and other subscriptions
            are unaffected. See <xref target="Error-handling"/> for more on this error condition.</t>
            <t>Finally, a subscription is terminated if the connection between the SW-PC and SW-PV is
            deleted. This occurs when the connection ID used in the messages between the SW-PC and the SW-PV
	    becomes unbound. Loss of this connection ID would prevent the SW-PC from sending messages in fulfillment
	    of this subscription. As such, loss of the connection ID necessarily forces subscription termination
	    between the affected parties.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Subscription Status">
          <t>A SW-PV can request that a SW-PC report the list of active subscriptions for which the SW-PV
            is the subscriber. A SW-PV can use this to recover lost information about active subscriptions.
            A SW-PV can also use this capability to verify that a SW-PC has not forgotten any of its
            subscriptions. The latter is especially useful where a SW-PC does not send any attributes in
            fulfillment of a given subscription for a long period of time. The SW-PV can check the list of active
            subscriptions on the SW-PC and verify whether the inactivity is due to a lack of reportable events
            or due to the SW-PC forgetting its obligations to fulfill a given subscription.</t>
            <t>A SW-PV requests a list of its subscriptions on a given SW-PC by sending that SW-PC a
            Subscription Status Request. The SW-PC MUST then respond with a Subscription Status
            Response (or a PA-TNC Error if an error condition is experienced). The Subscription Status Response
            MUST contain one subscription record for each of the active subscriptions for which the SW-PV is the
            subscribing party. </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Fulfilling Subscriptions">
          <t>As noted in <xref target="Monitoring-changes-in-an-endpoint"/> SW-PCs MUST have the ability 
	    to automatically detect changes to an
            endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection in near real-time. For every active subscription, the SW-PC MUST
            send an attribute to the subscribed SW-PV whenever a change is detected to relevant records within
            the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. Such an attribute is said to be sent "in
            fulfillment of" the given subscription and any such attribute MUST include that subscription's Subscription
            ID. If the establishing request for that subscription was a targeted request, then only records that match
            the Software Identifiers provided in that establishing request are considered relevant. Otherwise,
            (i.e., for non-targeted requests) any record is considered relevant for this purpose. 
	    <xref target="Subscription-establishment-and-fulfillment"/> shows a
            sample attribute exchange where a subscription is established and then later attributes are sent

          <t>The contents of an attribute sent in fulfillment of a subscription depend on the parameters provided
            in the establishing request for that subscription. Specifically, the contents of an attribute sent in
            fulfillment of a subscription have the same format as would a direct response to the establishing
            request. For example, if the establishing request stipulated a response that contained an event record
            list that included software inventory evidence records, all attributes sent
            in fulfillment of this subscription will also consist of event record lists with software inventory evidence
	    records. As such, all SW Responses displayed in the exchange depicted in 
	    <xref target="Subscription-establishment-and-fulfillment"/>
            have the same format. A SW Response generated in fulfillment of an active subscription MUST be
            a valid SW Response attribute according to all the rules outlined in the preceding sections. In other
            words, an attribute constructed in fulfillment of a subscription will look the same as an attribute sent
            in direct response to an explicit request from a SW-PV that had the same request parameters and
            which arrived immediately after the given change event. There are a few special rules that expand
            on this guideline:</t>
          <section title="Subscriptions Reporting Inventories">
            <t>In the case that a SW-PV subscribes to a SW-PC requesting an inventory attribute whenever
              changes are detected (i.e. the EID in the establishing request is 0), then the SW-PC MUST send
              the requested inventory whenever a relevant change is detected. (A "relevant change" is any change
              for untargeted requests, or a change to an indicated record in a targeted request.) Upon detection
              of a relevant change for an active subscription, the SW-PC sends the appropriate inventory
              information as if it had just received the establishing request. Attributes sent in fulfillment of this
              subscription will probably have a large amount of redundancy, as the same records are likely to be
              present in each of these SW Attributes. The role of an inventory subscription is not to report records
              just for the items that changed - that is the role of a subscription that reports events (see 
              <xref target="Subscriptions-reporting-events"/>). A SW-PC MUST NOT exclude a 
	      record from an attribute sent in fulfillment of an inventory
              subscription simply because that record was not involved in the triggering event (although a record might
              be excluded for other reasons, such as if the subscription is targeted - see 
	      <xref target="Targeted-subscriptions"/>).</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="Subscriptions-reporting-events" title="Subscriptions Reporting Events">
            <t>The way in which a SW-PV indicates it wishes to establish a subscription requesting event records
              is by providing a non-zero EID in the SW Request establishing the subscription 
	      (see <xref target="Change-event-records"/>).
              However, when the SW-PC constructs an attribute in fulfillment of the subscription (other than the
              direct response to the establishing request), it MUST only include event records for the detected
              change(s) that precipitated this response attribute. In other words, it MUST NOT send a complete list
              of all changes starting with the indicated EID, up through the latest change, every time a new event
              is detected. In effect, the EID in the establishing request is treated as being updated every time an
              attribute is sent in fulfillment of this subscription, such that a single event is not reported twice in
              fulfillment of a single subscription. As such, every SW-PC MUST track the EID of the last event
              that triggered an attribute for the given subscription. When the next event (or set of events) is
              detected, the SW-PC MUST only report events with EIDs after the last reported event. In the case that the EID Epoch of
              the SW-PC changes, the SW-PC MUST treat EID values in the new Epoch as being after all
              EIDs assigned in the previous Epoch regardless of the relative numeric values of these EIDs.</t>
              <t>Note that while a subscription is active, the subscribing SW-PV MAY make other requests for
              event records that overlap with events that are reported in fulfillment of a subscription. Such requests are
              unaffected by the presence of the subscription, nor is the subscription affected by such requests. In
              other words, a given request will get the same results back whether or not there was a subscription.
              Likewise, an attribute sent in fulfillment of a subscription will contain the same information whether or
              not other requests had been received from the SW-PV.</t>
              <t>A SW-PV needs to pay attention to the EID Epoch in these attributes, as changes in the Epoch
              might create discontinuities in the SW-PV's understanding of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
              state, as discussed in <xref target="Synchronizing-event-identifiers-and-epochs"/>. 
	      In particular, once the EID Epoch changes, a SW-PV is unable
              have confidence that it has a correct understanding of the state of an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection
              until after the SW-PV collects a complete inventory.</t>
              <t>SW-PCs MAY send partial lists of event records in fulfillment of a subscription. 
	      (See <xref target="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records"/>
              for more on partial list of event records.) In the case that a SW-PC sends a partial list of event
              records in fulfillment of a subscription, it MUST immediately send the next consecutive partial list, 
	      and continue doing so until it has
              sent the equivalent of the complete list of event records. In other words, if the SW-PC sends a
              partial list it does not wait for another change event to send another SW Response, but continues
              sending SW Responses until it has sent all event records that would have been included in a
              complete fulfillment of the subscription. Note that the direct response to the establishing request 
	      is not considered to be sent in fulfillment of a subscription. However, in this case the SW-PC MUST 
	      treat the presence of unreported events as a triggering event for pushing additional messages in 
	      fulfillment of the newly established subscription. As such, the net effect is that, if the direct response 
	      to the establishing request (i.e., the Subscription Fulfillment flag is unset) is partial, the SW-PC 
	      will immediately follow this with additional attributes (with the Subscription Fulfillment flag set) 
	      until the complete set of events has been sent to the SW-PV.</t>

          <section anchor="Targeted-subscriptions" title="Targeted Subscriptions">
            <t>Subscriptions MAY be targeted to only apply to records that match a given set of Software Identifiers. In the
              case where changes are detected that affect multiple records, some matching the establishing request's
              Software Identifiers and some not, the attribute sent in fulfillment of the subscription MUST only include
              inventory or events (as appropriate) for records that match the establishing request's Software Identifiers. The
              SW-PC MUST NOT include non-matching records in the attribute, even if those non-matching records
              experienced change events that were co-temporal with change events on the matching records.</t>
              <t>In addition, a SW-PC MUST send an attribute in fulfillment of a targeted subscription only when
              changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection impact one or more records matching the subscription's
              establishing request's Software Identifiers. A SW-PC MUST NOT send any attribute in fulfillment of a
              targeted subscription based on detected change to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection that did not
              involve any of the records targeted by that subscription.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="No-subscription-consolidation" title="No Subscription Consolidation">
            <t>A SW-PV MAY establish multiple subscriptions to a given SW-PC. If this is the case, it is
              possible that a single change event on the endpoint might require fulfillment by multiple subscriptions,
              and that the information included in attributes that fulfill each of these subscriptions might overlap.
              The SW-PC MUST send separate attributes for each established subscription that requires a
              response due to the given event. Each of these attributes MUST contain all information required to
              fulfill that individual subscription, even if that information is also sent in other attributes sent in
              fulfillment of other subscriptions at the same time. In other words, SW-PCs MUST NOT attempt
              to combine information when fulfilling multiple subscriptions simultaneously, even if this results in
              some redundancy in the attributes sent to the SW-PV.</t>
          </section>
          <section title="Delayed Subscription Fulfillment">
            <t>A SW-PC MAY delay the fulfillment of a subscription following a change event in the interest of
              waiting to see if additional change events are forthcoming and, if so, conveying the relevant records
              back to the SW-PV in a single SW Response attribute. This can help reduce network bandwidth
              consumption between the SW-PC and the SW-PV. For example, consider a situation where
              10 changes occur a tenth of a second apart. If the SW-PC does not delay in assembling and
              sending SW Response attributes, the SW-PV will receive 10 separate SW Response
              attributes over a period of 1 second. However, if the SW-PC waits half a second after the initial
              event before assembling a SW Response, the SW-PV only receives two SW Response
              attributes over the same period of time.</t>
              <t>Note that the ability to consolidate events for a single subscription over a given period of time does
              not contradict the rules in <xref target="No-subscription-consolidation"/> prohibiting 
	      consolidation across multiple subscriptions.
              When delaying fulfillment of subscriptions, SW-PCs are still required to fulfill each individual
              subscription separately. Moreover, in the case that change events within the delay window cancel
              each other out (e.g., a record is deleted and then re-added), the SW-PC MUST still report each
              change event rather than just reporting the net effect of changes over the delay period. In other words,
              delayed fulfillment can decrease the number of attributes send by the SW-PC, but it does not
              reduce the total number of change events reported.</t>
              <t>SW-PCs are not required to support delayed fulfillment of subscriptions. However, in the case that
              the SW-PC does support delayed subscription fulfillment, it MUST be possible to configure the
              SW-PC to disable delayed fulfillment. In other words, parties deploying SW-PCs need to be
              allowed to disable delayed subscription fulfillment in their SW-PCs. The manner in which such
              configuration occurs is left to the discretion of implementers, although implementers MUST protect
              the configuration procedure from unauthorized tampering. In other words, there needs to be some
              assurance that unauthorized individuals are not able to introduce long delays in subscription
              fulfillment.</t>

      <section anchor="Error-handling" title="Error Handling">
        <t>In the case where the SW-PC detects an error in a SW Request attribute that it receives it
          MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute with an error code appropriate to the nature of the error.
          (See Section 4.2.8 of PA-TNC <xref target="RFC5792"/> for more details about PA-TNC Error attributes and
          error codes as well as <xref target="SW-PA-TNC-error"/> in this specification for error codes 
	  specific to SW Attributes.)
          In the case that an error is detected in a SW Request the SW-PC MUST NOT take any action
          requested by this SW Request, even if partial completion of the SW is possible. 
	  In other words, a SW Request that contains an error is completely ignored by
          the SW-PC (beyond sending a PA-TNC Error attribute, and possibly logging the error locally) rather than 
	  being partially executed.</t>
          <t>In the case where the SW-PC receives a valid SW Request attribute but experiences an error
          during the process of responding to that attribute's instructions where that error prevents the SW-PC
          from properly or completely fulfilling that request, the SW-PC MUST send a PA-TNC Error
          attribute with an error code appropriate to the nature of the error. In the case where a PA-TNC Error
          attribute is sent, the SW-PC MUST NOT take any of the actions requested by the SW Request
          attribute which led to the detected error. This is the case even if some actions could have been completed
          successfully, and might even require the SW-PC to reverse some successful actions already
          taken before the error condition was detected. In other words, either all aspects of a SW Request
          complete fully and successfully (in which case the SW-PC sends a SW Response attribute), or
          no aspects of the SW Request occur (in which case the SW-PC sends a PA-TNC Error attribute).
          In the case that a SW-PC sends a PA-TNC Error attribute in response to a SW Request then the
          SW-PC MUST NOT also send any SW Response attribute in response to the same SW
          Request. For this reason, the sending of a SW Response attribute MUST be the last action taken
          by a SW-PC in response to a SW Request to avoid the possibility of a processing error occurring
          after that SW Response attribute is sent.</t>
          <t>In the case that the SW-PC detects an error that prevents it from properly or completely fulfilling
          its obligations under an active subscription, the SW-PC MUST send a PA-TNC Error attribute of type
          SW_SUBSCRIPTION_FULFILLMENT_ERROR to the SW-PV that established this
          subscription. This type of PA-TNC Error attribute identifies the specific subscription that cannot be
          adequately honored due to the error condition as well as an error "sub-type". The error sub-type is
          used to indicate the type of error condition the SW-PC experienced that prevented it from honoring
          the given subscription. In the case that the error condition cannot be identified or does not align with
          any of the defined error codes, the SW_ERROR error code SHOULD be used in the
          sub-type. In the case that a SW_SUBSCRIPTION_FULFILLMENT_ERROR is sent,
          the associated subscription MUST be treated as cancelled by both the SW-PC and SW-PV.</t>
          <t>The SW-PV MUST NOT send any PA-TNC Error attributes to SW-PCs. In the case that a SW-PV
          detects an error condition, it SHOULD log this error but does not inform any SW-PC's of this
          event. Errors might include, but are not limited to, detection of malformed SW Response attributes
          sent from a given SW-PC, as well as detection of error conditions when the SW-PV processes
          SW Responses.</t>
          <t>Both SW-PCs and SW-PVs SHOULD log errors so that administrators can trace the causes of
          errors. Log entries SHOULD include the type of the error, the time it was detected, and additional
          descriptive information to aid in understanding the nature and cause of the error.</t>

          <t>In order to ensure consistency of transmitted attributes some fields require normalization of

	  the field contents MUST be normalized to Network Unicode format as defined in
          RFC 5198 <xref target="RFC5198"/>. Network Unicode format defines a refinement of UTF-8 that ensures a normalized
          expression of characters. SW-PCs and SW-PVs MUST NOT perform conversion and
          normalization on any field values except those specifically identified as requiring normalization
	  in the following sections. Note, however, that some data models require additional normalization 
	  before source information is added to an Endpoint's Inventory Evidence Collection as a record. 
	  The references from the Software Data Model IANA table (see <xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/>) 
	  will note where this is necessary.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="Request-ids" title="Request IDs">
        <t>All SW Request attributes MUST include a Request ID value. The Request ID field provides a value
          that identifies a given request relative to other requests between a SW-PV and the receiving
          SW-PC. Specifically, the SW-PV assigns each SW Request attribute a Request ID value
          that is intended to be unique within the lifetime of a given network connection ID as assigned by the
          SW-PV's Posture Broker Server.</t> 
          <t>In the case that a SW Request requests the establishment of a subscription and the receiving
          SW-PC agrees to that subscription, the Request ID of that SW Request (i.e., the establishing
          request of the subscription) becomes that subscription's Subscription ID. All attributes sent in
          fulfillment of this subscription include a flag indicating that the attribute fulfills a subscription and the
          subscription's Subscription ID. A SW-PV MUST NOT reuse a Request ID value in communicating
          to a given SW-PC while that Request ID is also serving as a Subscription ID for an active
          subscription with that SW-PC. In the case where a SW-PC receives a SW Request from a
          given SW-PV where that Request ID is also the Subscription ID of an active subscription with that
          SW-PV, the SW-PC MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute with an error code of
          SW_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_REUSE_ERROR. Note that this error does not cancel the
          indicated subscription.</t>
          <t>Subscription Status Requests and Subscription Status Responses do not include Request IDs.</t>
        <t>In the case where
          all possible Request ID values have been exhausted within the lifetime of a single network connection
          ID, the sender MAY reuse previously used Request IDs within the same network connection if the ID is not
          being used as a Subscription ID. In such a case of Request ID reuse, Request IDs SHOULD be reused in the order of their
          original use. In
          other words, a SW-PC SHOULD NOT use a given Request ID value more than once within a
          persistent connection between a given Posture Broker Client-Posture Broker Server pair.
          In the case where reuse is necessary
          due to exhaustion of possible ID values, the SW-PC SHOULD structure the reuse to maximize
          the time between original and subsequent use. The Request ID value is included in a SW Response
          attribute directly responding to this SW Request to indicate which SW Request was received and
          caused the response. Request IDs can be randomly generated or sequential, as long as values are
          not repeated per the rules in this paragraph. SW-PCs are not required to check for duplicate
          Request IDs.</t>

  <ttcol>Field</ttcol>
  <ttcol>Description</ttcol>

  <c>Flags: Bit 0 - Clear Subscriptions</c>
  <c>If set (1), the SW-PC MUST delete all subscriptions established by the requesting SW-PV (barring any errors).</c>

  <c>Flags: Bit 1 - Subscribe</c>
  <c>If set (1), in addition to responding to the request as described, the SW-PC MUST establish 
  a subscription with parameters matching those in the request attribute (barring any errors).</c>
      
  <c>Flags: Bit 2 - Result Type</c>
  <c>If unset (0), the SW-PC's response MUST include software inventory evidence records and thus the response 
  MUST be a Software Inventory, a Software Events, or a PA-TNC Error attribute. If set (1), the response 
  MUST NOT include software inventory evidence records and thus the response MUST be a Software Identifier 
  Inventory, a Software Identifier Events, or a PA-TNC Error attribute.</c>

  <c>Flags: Bit 3-7 - Reserved</c>
  <c>Reserved for future use. This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon reception.</c>

  <c>Software Identifier Count</c>
  <c>A 3-byte unsigned integer indicating the number of Software Identifiers that follow. If this value 
    is non-zero, this is a targeted request, as described in <xref target="Targeted-requests"/>. 
    The Software Identifier Length and Software
    Identifier fields are repeated, in order, the number of times indicated in this field. In the case where Software 
    Identifiers are present, the SW-PC MUST only report software that 
    corresponds to the identifiers the SW-PV provided in this attribute (or with a PA-TNC Error attribute).
    This field value MAY be 0, in which case there are no instances of the Software Identifier Length 
    and Software Identifier fields. In this case, the SW-PV is indicating an 
    interest in all software inventory evidence records on the endpoint (i.e., this is not a targeted request).
  </c>

  <c>Request ID</c>
  <c>A value that uniquely identifies this SW Request from a particular SW-PV.</c>
  
  <c>Earliest EID</c>
  <c>In the case where the SW-PV is requesting software events, this field contains the EID value of the 
     earliest event the SW-PV wishes to have reported. (Note - the report will be inclusive of the event 
     with this EID value.) In the case where the SW-PV is requesting an inventory, then this field MUST be 
     0. (0x00000000) In the case where this field is non-zero, the SW-PV is requesting events and the SW-PC 
     MUST respond using a Software Events, Software Identifier Events, or a PA-TNC Error attribute. In the case 
     where this field is zero, the SW-PV is requesting an inventory and the SW-PC MUST respond using a 
     Software Inventory, a Software Identifier Inventory, or a PA-TNC Error attribute.</c>

   <c>Software Identifier Length</c>
   <c>A 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length in bytes of the Software Identifier field.</c>

   <c>Software Identifier</c>
   <c>A string containing the Software Identifier value from a software inventory evidence record. This field value MUST be 
     normalized to Network Unicode format, as described in <xref target="Normalize-text-encoding"/>. 
     This string MUST NOT be NULL terminated.</c>
</texttable>
        <t>The SW-PV sends the SW Request attribute to a SW-PC to request the indicated
          information. Note that between the Result Type flag and the Earliest EID field, the SW-PC is
          constrained to a single possible SW Response attribute type (or a PA-TNC Error attribute) in its
          response to the request.</t>
          <t>The Subscribe and Clear Subscription flags are used to manage subscriptions for the requesting
          SW-PV on the receiving SW-PC. Specifically, an attribute with the Subscribe flag set seeks to
          establish a new subscription by the requesting SW-PV to the given SW-PC, while an attribute
          with the Clear Subscription flag seeks to delete all existing subscriptions by the requesting SW-PV
          on the given SW-PC. Note that, in the latter case, only the subscriptions associated with the
          Connection ID and the Posture Validator ID of the requester are deleted as described in 
	  <xref target="Terminating-subscriptions"/>.
          A newly established subscription has the parameters outlined in the Request attribute. Specifically,
          the Result Type flag indicates the type of result to send in fulfillment of the subscription, the value of
          the Earliest EID field indicates whether the fulfillment attributes list inventories or events, and the
          fields describing Software Identifiers (if present) indicate if and how a subscription is targeted. In the case
          that the SW-PC is unable or unwilling to comply with the SW-PV's request to establish or clear
          subscriptions, the SW-PC MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute with the
          SW_SUBSCRIPTION_DENIED_ERROR error code. If the SW-PV
          requests that subscriptions be cleared but has no existing subscriptions, this is not an error.</t>
          <t>An attribute requesting the establishment of a subscription is effectively doing double-duty, as it is a
          request for an immediate response from the SW-PC in addition to setting up the subscription. Assuming the
          SW-PC is willing to comply with the subscription it MUST send an appropriate response attribute to a 
	  request with the Subscribe flag set
          containing all requested information. The same is true of the Clear Subscription flag - assuming there is no error the SW-PC
          MUST generate a response attribute without regard to the presence of this flag in addition to clearing
          its subscription list.</t>
          <t>Both the Subscribe and Clear Subscription flags MAY be set in a single SW Request attribute. In
          the case where this request is successful, the end result MUST be equivalent to the SW-PC
          clearing its subscription list for the given SW-PV first and then creating a new subscription in
          accordance with the request parameters. In other words, do not first create the new subscription and
          then clear all the subscriptions including the one that was just created. In the case that the requested
          actions are successfully completed, the SW-PC MUST respond with a SW Response attribute.
          The specific type of SW Response attribute depends on the Result Type and Earliest EID fields,
          as described above. In the case where there is a failure that prevents some part this request from
          completing, the SW-PC MUST NOT add a new subscription, MUST NOT clear the old
          subscriptions, and the SW-PC MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute. In other words, the
          SW-PC MUST NOT partially succeed at implementing such a request; either all actions
          succeed, or none succeed.</t>
          <t>The Earliest EID field is used to indicate if the SW-PV is
          requesting an inventory or event list from the SW-PC. A value
          of 0 (0x00000000) represents a request for inventory
          information. Otherwise, the SW-PV is requesting event
          information. For Earliest EID values other than 0, the SW-PC's
          response MUST respond with event records, as described in
            <xref target="Reporting-change-events"/>. Note that the
          request does not identify a particular EID Epoch, since
          responses can only include events in the SW-PC's current EID
          Epoch.</t>
          <t>The Software Identifier Count indicates the number of
          Software Identifiers in the attribute. This number might be
          any value between 0 and 16,777,216, inclusive. A single
          Software Identifier is represented by the following fields:
          Software Identifier Length and Software Identifier. These
          fields are repeated a number of times equal to the Software
          Identifier Count, which may be 0. The Software Identifier
          Length field indicates the number of bytes allocated to the
          Software Identifier field. The Software Identifier field
          contains a Software Identifier as describe in <xref
            target="software-identifiers"/>. The presence of one or more
          Software Identifiers is used by the SW-PV to indicate a
          targeted request, which seeks only inventories of or events
          affecting software corresponding to the given identifiers. The
          SW-PC MUST only report software that matched the Software
          Identifiers provided in the SW-PVs SW Request attribute.</t>

        <t>A SW-PC sends this attribute to a SW-PV to convey the inventory of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection

          targeted list of records, depending on the parameters in the SW-PV's request. A SW-PV MUST
          NOT send this attribute. The SW-PC either sends this attribute in fulfillment of an existing
          subscription where the establishing request has a Result Type of 1 and the Earliest EID is zero, or in

          response to a SW Request that establishes a subscription (i.e., a subscription's establishing
          request) MUST be treated as a direct response to that SW Request (and thus the Subscription

	  <c>Reserved for future use. This field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon reception.</c>

	  <c>Event Count</c>
	  <c>The number of events that are reported in this attribute. This field is a 3-byte unsigned integer. 
	  The EID, Timestamp, Record Identifier, Data Model Type PEN, Data Model Type, Software Identifier Length, Software Locator Length, 
	  Source Identification Number, Action, Software Identifier, and Software Locator 
	  fields are repeated, in order, the number of times indicated in 
	  this field. This field value MAY be 0, in which 
	  case there are no instances of these fields.
	  </c>

	  <c>Request ID Copy / Subscription ID</c>
	  <c>In the case where this attribute is in direct response to a SW Request attribute from a SW-PV, this 
	  field MUST contain an exact copy of the Request ID field from that SW Request.
	  In the case where this attribute is sent in fulfillment of an active subscription, this field MUST 
	  contain the Subscription ID of the subscription being fulfilled by this attribute.</c>

	  <c>EID Epoch</c>
	  <c>The EID Epoch of the Last EID value. This field is an unsigned 4-byte integer.</c>

	  <c>Last EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the last event recorded by the SW-PC, or 0 if the SW-PC has no recorded 
	  events. This field contains the EID of the SW-PC's last recorded change event (which might or 
	  might not be included as an event record in this attribute).</c>
  
	  <c>Last Consulted EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the last event record that was consulted when generating the event record list included 
	  in this attribute. This is different from the Last EID field value if and only if this attribute is 
	  conveying a partial list of event records. See <xref target="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records"/> 
	  for more on partial list of event records.</c>

	  <c>EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the event in this event record.</c>

	  <c>Timestamp</c>
	  <c>The timestamp associated with the event in this event record. This timestamps is the SW-PC's 
	  best understanding of when the given event occurred. Note that this timestamp might be an estimate.
	  The Timestamp date and time MUST be represented as an RFC 3339 [5] compliant ASCII string in Coordinated 
	  Universal Time (UTC) time with the additional restrictions that the 'T' delimiter and the 'Z' suffix MUST 
	  be capitalized and fractional seconds (time-secfrac) MUST NOT be included. This field conforms to the 
	  date-time ABNF production from section 5.6 of RFC 3339 <xref target="RFC3339"/> with the above restrictions. 
	  Leap seconds are 
	  permitted and SW-PVs MUST support them.
	  The Timestamp string MUST NOT be NULL terminated or padded in any way. The length of this field is always 20 octets.</c>

	  <c>Record Identifier</c>
	  <c>A 4-byte, unsigned integer containing the Record Identifier value from a software inventory evidence record. </c>

	  <c>Data Model Type PEN</c>
	  <c>A 3-byte unsigned integer containing the Private Enterprise Number (PEN) of the organization that 
	  assigned the meaning of the Data Model Type value.</c>
	  
	  <c>Data Model Type</c>
	  <c>A 1-byte unsigned integer containing an identifier number 
	  that identifies the data model of the reported record.</c>
	  
	  <c>Software Identifier Length</c>
	  <c>A 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length in bytes of the SW ID field.</c>
	  
	  <c>Software Locator Length</c>
	  <c>A 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length in bytes of the Software Locator field.</c>
	  
	  <c>Source Identification Number</c>
	  <c>The Source Identification Number associated with the source from which this software 
	  installation inventory instance was reported.</c>

	  <c>Action</c>
	  <c>The type of event that is recorded in this event record. Possible values are: 1 = CREATION - the addition of a
	  record to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection; 2 = DELETION - the removal 
	  of a record from the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection;
	  3 = ALTERATION - There was an alteration to a record within the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. All other values 
	  are reserved for future use and MUST NOT be used when sending attributes. In the case where a SW-PV 
	  receives an event record that uses an action value other than the ones defined here, it MUST ignore 
	  that event record but SHOULD process other event records in this attribute as normal.
	  </c>

	  <c>Software Identifier</c>
	  <c>A string containing the Software Identifier value from a software inventory evidence record. This field value 
	  MUST be normalized to Network Unicode format, as described in <xref target="Normalize-text-encoding"/>. This string MUST NOT be 
	  NULL terminated.</c>

	  <c>Software Locator</c>
	  <c>A string containing the Software Locator value. This is expressed as a URI. This field value MUST be normalized 
	  to Network Unicode format as described in <xref target="software-locator"/>. This string MUST NOT be NULL terminated.</c>
	  
	</texttable>
        <t>The first few fields in the Software Identifier Events attribute mirror those in the Software Identifier
          Inventory attribute. The primary difference is that, instead of conveying an inventory, the attribute conveys 
	  zero or more event records, consisting of the EID, timestamp, Record Identifier, 
          action type, data model type, Software Identifier, and Software Locator of the affected software inventory evidence record.</t>
          <t>With regard to the Timestamp field, it is important to note that clock skew between the SW-PC
          and SW-PV as well as between different SW-PCs within an enterprise might make correlation
          of timestamp values difficult. This specification does not attempt to resolve clock skew issues,
          although other mechanisms outside of this specification do exist to reduce the impact of clock skew
          and make the timestamp more useful for such correlation. Instead, Software Inventory Message and Attributes for
          PA-TNC uses Timestamp value primarily as a means to indicate the amount of time between two events
          on a single endpoint. For example, by taking the difference of the times for when a record was
          removed and then subsequently re-added, one can get an indication as to how long the system was
          without the given record (and, thus without the associated software). Since this will involve comparison
          of timestamp values all originating on the same system, clock skew between the SW-PC and
          SW-PV is not an issue. However, if the SW-PC's clock was adjusted between two recorded
          events, it is possible for such a calculation to lead to incorrect understandings of the temporal distance
          between events. Users of this field need to be aware of the possibility for such occurrences. In the
          case where the Timestamp values of two events appear to contradict the EID ordering of those events
          (i.e., the later EID has an earlier timestamp) the recipient MUST treat the EID ordering as correct.</t>
          <t>All events recorded in a Software Identifier Events Attribute are required to be part of the same EID Epoch.
          Specifically, all reported events MUST have an EID from the same EID Epoch as each other, and
          which is the same as the EID Epoch of the Last EID and Last Consulted EID values. The SW-PC
          MUST NOT report events with EIDs from different EID Epochs.</t>
          <t>The Last Consulted EID field contains the EID of the last event record considered for inclusion in this
          attribute. If this attribute contains a partial event set (as described in 
	  <xref target="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records"/>) this field value
          will be less than the Last EID value; if this attribute contains a complete event set, the Last EID
          and Last Consulted EID values are identical.</t>
          <t>If multiple events are sent in a Software Identifier Events attribute, the order in which they appear
          within the attribute is not significant. The EIDs associated with them are used for ordering the
          indicated events appropriately. Also note that a single software record might be reported multiple
          times in an attribute, such as if multiple events involving the associated record were being reported.</t>

	  In the case where this attribute is sent in fulfillment of an active subscription, this field MUST 
	  contain the Subscription ID of the subscription being fulfilled by this attribute.</c>

	  <c>EID Epoch</c>
	  <c>The EID Epoch of the Last EID value. This field is an unsigned 4-byte integer.</c>

	  <c>Last EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the last event recorded by the SW-PC, or 0 if the SW-PC has no recorded 
	  events. This field contains the EID of the SW-PC's last recorded change event (which might or 
	  might not be included as an event record in this attribute).</c>
  
	  <c>Last Consulted EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the last event record that was consulted when generating the event record list included 
	  in this attribute. This is different from the Last EID field value if and only if this attribute is 
	  conveying a partial list of event records. See <xref target="Partial-and-complete-lists-of-event-records"/> 
	  for more on partial list of event records.</c>

	  <c>EID</c>
	  <c>The EID of the event in this event record.</c>

	  <c>Timestamp</c>
	  <c>The timestamp associated with the event in this event record. This timestamp is the SW-PC's 
	  best understanding of when the given event occurred. Note that this timestamp might be an estimate.
	  The Timestamp date and time MUST be represented as an RFC 3339 [5] compliant ASCII string in Coordinated 
	  Universal Time (UTC) time with the additional restrictions that the 'T' delimiter and the 'Z' suffix MUST 
	  be capitalized and fractional seconds (time-secfrac) MUST NOT be included. This field conforms to the 
	  date-time ABNF production from section 5.6 of RFC 3339 <xref target="RFC3339"/> with the above restrictions. 
	  Leap seconds are 
	  permitted and SW-PVs MUST support them.
	  The Timestamp string MUST NOT be NULL terminated or padded in any way. The length of this field is always 20 octets.</c>

	  <c>Record Identifier</c>
	  <c>A 4-byte, unsigned integer containing the Record Identifier value from a software inventory evidence record. </c>

	  <c>Data Model Type PEN</c>
	  <c>A 3-byte unsigned integer containing the Private Enterprise Number (PEN) of the organization that 
	  assigned the meaning of the Data Model Type value.</c>
	
	  <c>Data Model Type</c>
	  <c>A 1-byte unsigned integer containing an identifier number 
	  that identifies the data model of the reported record.</c>

	  <c>Software Identifier Length</c>
	  <c>A 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length in bytes of the Software Identifier field.</c>

	  <c>Software Locator Length</c>
	  <c>A 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length in bytes of the Software Locator field.</c>

	  <c>Record Length</c>
	  <c>This is a 4-byte unsigned integer indicating the length of the Record field in bytes.</c>

	  <c>Source Identification Number</c>
	  <c>The Source Identification Number associated with the source from which this software 
	  installation inventory instance was reported.</c>

	  <c>Action</c>
	  <c>The type of event that is recorded in this event record. Possible values are: 1 = CREATION - the addition of a
	  record to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection; 2 = DELETION - the removal of a record
	  from the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection;
	  3 = ALTERATION - There was an alteration to a record within the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. All other values 
	  are reserved for future use and MUST NOT be used when sending attributes. In the case where a SW-PV 
	  receives an event record that uses an action value other than the ones defined here, it MUST ignore 
	  that event record but SHOULD process other event records in this attribute as normal.
	  </c>

	  <c>Software Identifier</c>
	  <c>A string containing the Software Identifier value from a software inventory evidence record. This field value 
	  MUST be normalized to Network Unicode format, as described in <xref target="Normalize-text-encoding"/>. This string MUST NOT be 
	  NULL terminated.</c>
	  
	  <c>Software Locator</c>
	  <c>A string containing the Software Locator value. This is expressed as a URI. This field value MUST be normalized 
	  to Network Unicode format as described in <xref target="software-locator"/>. This string MUST NOT be NULL terminated.</c>

	  <c>Record</c>
	  <c>A software inventory evidence record as a string. The record MUST be converted and normalized to 
	  Network Unicode format, as described in 
	  <xref target="Normalize-text-encoding"/>. This string MUST 
	  NOT be NULL terminated.</c>
	</texttable>
        <t>The fields of this attribute are used in the same way as the corresponding fields of the previous
          attributes. As with the Software Inventory attribute, a Software Events attribute can be quite large
          if many events have occurred following the event indicated by a request's Earliest EID. As such, it is
          recommended that the SW Request attributes only request full records be sent (Result Type set to 0)
          in a targeted request, thus constraining the response just to records that match a given set of Software
          Identifiers.</t>
          <t>As with the Software Identifier Events Attribute, this attribute MUST only contain event records with
          EIDs coming from the current EID Epoch of the SW-PC.</t>
          <t>As with the Software Inventory Attribute, the SW-PC MUST perform conversion and
          normalization of the record.</t>

	  <c>Subscription Record Count</c>
	  <c>The number of subscription records that follow. This field is a 3-byte unsigned integer. 
	  The Flags, Software Identifier Count, Request ID, Earliest EID, Software Identifier Length, and Software Identifier 
	  fields are repeated, in order, the number of times indicated in 
	  this field. This field value MAY be 0 in which case there are no instances of these fields.</c>

	  <c>Flags, Software Identifier Count, Request ID, Earliest EID, Software Identifier Length, and 
	  Software Identifier</c>
	  <c>For each active subscription, these fields contain an exact copy of the fields with the same 
	  name as provided in the subscription's establishing request.</c>
	</texttable>
        <t>A Subscription Status Response contains zero or more subscription records. Specifically, it MUST
          contain one subscription record for each active subscription associated with the party that sent the
          Subscription Status Request to which this attribute is a response. As described 
	  in <xref target="Managing-subscriptions"/>, the
          SW-PC MUST use the requester's Connection ID and its Posture Validator ID to determine which
          subscriptions are associated with the requester.</t>
          <t>A SW-PC MUST send a Subscription Status Response attribute in response to a Subscription
          Status Request attribute. The only exception to this is if the SW-PC experiences an error condition
          that prevents it from correctly populating the Subscription Status Response attribute, in which case it
          MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error attribute appropriate to the type of error experienced. If there are
          no active subscriptions associated with the requesting party, the Subscription Status Response
          attribute will consist of its Status Flags field, a Subscription Record Count field with a value of 0, and
          no additional fields.</t>
          <t>Each subscription record included in a Subscription Status Response attribute duplicates the fields
          of a SW Request attribute that was the establishing request of a subscription. Note that the Request
          ID field in the record captures the Subscription ID associated with the given subscription record (since
          the Subscription ID is the same as the Request ID of the establishing request). Note also that if the
          establishing request is targeted, then its Record Count field will be non-zero and, within that
          subscription record, the Software Identifier Length and Software Identifier fields are repeated, 
	  in order, the number of times indicated in the Record Count field. As
          such, each subscription record can be different sizes. If the establishing request is not
          targeted (Record Count field is 0), the subscription record has no Software Identifier Length
	  or Software Identifier fields.</t>
          <t>When a SW-PV compares the information received in a Subscription Status Response to its own
          records of active subscriptions it should be aware that the SW-PC might be unable to distinguish
          this SW-PV from other SW-PVs on the same NEA Server. As a result, it is possible that the SW-PC
          will report more subscription records than the SW-PV recognizes. For this reason, SW-PVs
          SHOULD NOT automatically assume that extra subscriptions reported in a Subscription Status
          Response indicate a problem.</t>

	<t>A Source Metadata Response attribute contains 0 or more records, each describing one 
	of the data sources the SW-PC uses to collect software inventory information. It SHOULD 
	contain one metadata record for each source that the SW-PC uses. (There might be reasons 
	not to inform certain SW-PVs of the presence of certain data sources.) The attribute MUST 
	contain a metadata record for each source that has been identified in inventory or event 
	messages to the given SW-PV.</t>
	<t>A SW-PC MUST send a Source Metadata Response attribute in
	response to a Source Metadata Request attribute.  The only
	exception to this is if the SW-PC experiences an error condition that
	prevents it from correctly populating the Source Metadata
	Response attribute, in which case it MUST respond with a PA-TNC Error
	attribute appropriate to the type of error experienced.</t>
	<t>The Source Count field indicates how many source metadata records are included in the 
	attribute. Each included record consists of a Source Identifier, Metadata Length, and 
	Metadata field.</t>
	<t>The Source Identifier corresponds to the Source Identifier field in inventory and 
	event messages. In the case where the Source Identifier value in a Source Metadata 
	Response attribute matches a Source Identifier associated with an event or inventory 
	record and both the Source Metadata Response and the inventory/event record were sent to 
	the same SW-PV, the source described in the Metadata field MUST be the same source that 
	provided the event or inventory record associated with the Source Identifier. Recall that 
	a SW-PC MAY use different Source Identifier associations with different SW-PVs. When 
	sending to a giving SW-PV, the SW-PC MUST use the recipient SW-PVs Source Identifier 
	associations.</t>
	<t>The Metadata Length indicates the length, in bytes, if the Metadata field. The Metadata 
	field contains information about the indicated data source. This specification does not 
	dictate a format for the contents of the Metadata field. This field MAY include 
	machine-readable information. For broadest utility, the Metadata field SHOULD 
	include human-readable, descriptive information about the data source.</t>

      <section anchor="SW-PA-TNC-error" title="PA-TNC Error as Used by Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC">
        <t>The PA-TNC Error attribute is defined in the PA-TNC specification <xref target="RFC5792"/>, and its use here conforms
          to that specification. A PA-TNC Error can be sent due to any error in the PA-TNC exchange
          and might also be sent in response to error conditions specific to the Software Inventory Message
          and Attributes for PA-TNC exchange. The latter case utilizes error codes defined below.</t>

	  <t>A PA-TNC Error MUST be sent by a
              SW-PC in response to a SW Request in the case where the
              SW-PC encounters a fatal error (i.e., an error that
              prevents further processing of an exchange) relating to
              the attribute exchange. A SW-PV MUST NOT send this
              attribute. In
              the case where the SW-PV experiences a fatal error, it
              MUST handle the error without sending a
              PA-TNC Error attribute. The SW-PV MAY
              take other actions in response to the error, such as
              logging the cause of the error, or even taking actions to
              isolate the endpoint.</t>

          <t>A PA-TNC Error attribute is sent instead of a SW Response attribute due to factors that prevent the
          reliable creation of a SW Response. As such, a SW-PC MUST NOT send both a PA-TNC Error
          attribute and a SW Response attribute in response to a single SW Request attribute.</t>

          <t><xref target="PA-TNC-error-codes-for-SW"/> lists the Error Code values for the PA-TNC Error 
	  attribute specific to the Software Inventory Message and
          Attributes for PA-TNC exchange. Error codes are shown in both hexadecimal and decimal format.
	  In all of these cases, the Error Code Vendor ID field MUST be set to
          0x000000, corresponding to the IETF SMI Private Enterprise Number. The Error Information
          structures for each error type are described in the following subsections.</t>
          <t>Note that a message with a Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC attribute might also result in an
          error condition covered by the Standard PA-TNC Error Codes defined in PA-TNC. For
          example, a SW Attribute might have an invalid parameter, leading to an error code of "Invalid
          Parameter". In this case, the SW-PC MUST use the appropriate PA-TNC Error Code value as defined
          in Section 4.2.8 of PA-TNC specification.</t>

	    that, in the latter case, the SW_RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE_ERROR

      <t>Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC supports
        an extensible list of data models for representing and
        transmitting software inventory information. This list of data
        models appears in the Software Data Model IANA registry (see
          <xref target="IANA_Software_Data_Models"/>). This document
        provides guidance for an initial set of data models. Other
        documents might provide guidance on the use of new data models
        by Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC, and
        will be referenced by extensions to the Software Data Model IANA
        registry.</t>
      <section title="ISO 2015 SWID Tags using XML">
	<t>The International Organization for Standardization and the
          International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) published
          the specification governing SWID tag construction and use in
          2009 with a revised version published in 2015. <xref
            target="SWID15"/> Since that time, a growing number of
          vendors have integrated SWID tags into their software
          products. Doing so significantly simplifies the task of
          identifying these pieces of software: instead of relying on
          discovery processes that look for clues as to software
          presence, such as the presence of particular files or registry
          keys. A readily available list of SWID tags provides simple
          and immediate evidence as to the presence of the given piece
          of software.</t>
	<t>SWID Message and Attributes for PA-TNC has no reliance on the presence or management of SWID tags 
	on an endpoint as described in the ISO specification. However, the data model for describing software 
	that is presented in the ISO specification provides a robust and comprehensive way of describing 
	software and is adopted here as a means of representing and transmitting software information. 
	It should be emphasized, the use of the ISO SWID tag data model makes no assumption as to whether 
	the source of the recorded information was, in fact, an ISO SWID tag harvested from the endpoint or 
	whether the information was created using some other source and normalized to the SWID format.</t>
	<section title="Guidance on Normalizing Source Data to ISO 2015 SWID Tags using XML">
	  <t>Any record associated with this Software Data Model Type MUST conform to the ISO/IEC 19770-2-2015

	  specification. Any such tag SHOULD use a UTF-8 encoding, but MUST NOT alter the existing encoding if 
	  doing so would invalidate digital signatures included in the tag.</t>
	  <t>If generating a new ISO 2015 SWID tag, the software generating the
            tag MUST use a Tag Creator RegID that is associated
            with the generating software, unless this is impossible, in
            which case it MUST use the "http://invalid.unavailable" Tag
            Creator RegID value. Do not use a RegID associated with any
            other party. In particular, it is incorrect to use a Tag
            Creator RegID associated with the software being described
            by the tag, the enterprise that is using the software, or
            any other entity except that of the party that built the
            tool that is generating the SWID tag. This reflects the
            requirement that the Tag Creator RegID identify the party

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This section discusses some of the security threats facing
        Posture Collectors and Posture Validators that implement the
        Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC protocol.
        This section primarily notes potential issues for implementers
        to consider, although it does contain a handful of normative
        requirements to address certain security issues. The issues
        identified below focus on capabilities specific to this
        document. Implementers are advised to consult other relevant NEA
        specifications, particularly <xref target="RFC5209"/> (the NEA Architecture)
	and <xref target="RFC5792"/> (PA-TNC),
        for security issues that are applicable to such components in
        general.</t>
      <section title="Evidentiary Value of Software Inventory Evidence Records">
        <t>The degree to which an endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence
          Collection accurately reflects the endpoint's actual software
          load and any changes made to this software load is dependent
          on the accuracy of the tools used to populate and manage the
          software inventory evidence records in this collection. Some
          tools might not be designed to update records in the Software
          Inventory Evidence Collection in real time, resulting in a
          collection that is out-of-sync with actual system state.
          Moreover, tools might inaccurately characterize software, or
          fail to properly record its removal. Finally, it is likely
          that there will be software on the endpoint that is not
          tracked by any source and thus is not reflected in the
          Software Inventory Evidence Collection. Users of collected
          software inventory evidence records need to understand that
          the information provided by the Software Inventory Message and
          Attributes for PA-TNC capability cannot be treated as
          completely accurate. Nonetheless, having endpoints report this
          information can still provide useful insights into the state
          of the endpoint's software load, and can alert administrators
          and policy tools of situations that require remediation.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="Sensitivity-of-collected-tags" title="Sensitivity of Collected Records">
        <t>Software records on an endpoint are generally not considered to be sensitive, although there can be exceptions
          to this generalization as noted in the section on Privacy Considerations. In general, an endpoint's
          Software Inventory Evidence Collection can be browsed and individual records read by any party with access to the endpoint.
          This is generally not considered to be problematic, as those with access to the endpoint can usually
          learn of everything disclosed by that endpoint's records simply by inspecting other parts of the endpoint.</t>
        <t>The situation changes when an endpoint's inventory records are collected and stored off of the endpoint
          itself, such as on a NEA Server or CMDB. Inventory records represent a wealth of information about the endpoint in
          question and, for an adversary who does not already have access to the endpoint, a collection of the
          endpoint's inventory records might provide many details that are useful for mounting an attack. A list of the inventory records
          associated with an endpoint reveals a list of software installed on the endpoint. This list can be very
          detailed, noting specific versions and even patch levels, which an adversary can use to
          identify vulnerable software and design efficacious attacks.</t>
          <t>In addition, other information might also be gleaned from a collection of software inventory records:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>An inventory record might include information about where the product was installed on a given
              endpoint. This can reveal details about the file organization of that endpoint that an attacker
              can utilize.</t>
              <t>An inventory record might include information about how the software was provided to the endpoint,
              who in an organization signs off on the package release, and who packaged the product for
              installation. This information might be used as a starting point for the development of supply
              chain attacks.</t>
              <t>Events affecting inventory records are reported with timestamps indicating when each given event
              occurred. This can give the attacker an indication of how quickly an organization distributes
              patches and updates, helping the attacker determine how long an attack window might
              remain open.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Any consolidated software inventory is a potential risk,
          because such an inventory can provide an adversary an insight
          into the enterprise's configuration and management process. It
          is recommended that a centralized software inventory record
          collection be protected against unauthorized access.
          Mechanisms to accomplish this can include encrypting the data
          at rest, ensuring that access to the data is limited only to
          authorized individuals and processes, and other basic security
          precautions.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Integrity of Endpoint Records">
        <t>SW-PCs maintain records of detected changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection. These
          records are used to respond to a SW-PV's request for change events. The SW-PV might use
          a list of reported events to update its understanding of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection without
          needing to receive a full inventory report from the SW-PC. For this reason, preserving the integrity
          of the SW-PC's record of events is extremely important. If an attacker modifies the SW-PC's
          record of changes to the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection, this might cause the SW-PV's
          understanding of the endpoint's Software Inventory Evidence Collection to differ from its actual state. Results might
          include leading the SW-PV to believe that absent software was present, that present software was
          absent, that patches have been installed even if this is not the case, or to be unaware of other
          changes to Software Inventory Evidence Records. As such, the SW-PC MUST take steps to protect the integrity of its event
          records.</t>
          <t>In addition, records of established SW-PV subscriptions also require protection against manipulation
          or corruption. If an attacker is able to modify or delete records of an established subscription by a
          SW-PV, the SW-PC might fail to correctly fulfill this subscription. The SW-PV would not be
          aware that its subscription was not being correctly fulfilled unless it received additional information
          that indicated a discrepancy. For example, the SW-PV might collect a full inventory and realize
          from this that certain events had not been correctly reported in accordance with an established
          subscription. For this reason, the SW-PC MUST protect the integrity of subscription records.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="SW-PC Access Permissions">
        <t>A SW-PC requires sufficient permissions to collect Software Inventory Evidence Records from all of its supported sources,
	  as well as sufficient permissions to interact with the
          endpoint's Posture Broker Client. With regard to the former, this might require permissions to read the contents of
          directories throughout the file system. Depending on the operating environment and other activities
          undertaken by a SW-PC (or software that incorporates a SW-PC as one of its capabilities)
          additional permissions might be required by the SW-PC software. The SW-PC SHOULD NOT
          be granted permissions beyond what it needs in order to fulfill its duties.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Sanitization of Record Fields">
        <t>Not all sources of software inventory evidence are necessarily tightly controlled. For example, consider a 
	  source that gathers .swid files from the endpoint's file system. Any party could create a new .swid file
	  that could be collected and turned into a Software Inventory Evidence Record. As a result, it is important
	  that the contents of source information not be automatically trusted. In particular, tools that read source
	  information and the Software Inventory Evidence Records derived therefrom, including SW-PCs,
          need to be careful to sanitize input to prevent buffer overflow attacks, encoding attacks, and other
          weaknesses that might be exploited by an adversary who can control the contents of a record.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="PA-TNC Security Threats">
        <t>In addition to the aforementioned considerations the Software Inventory Message and Attributes for PA-TNC protocol
          is subject to the same security threats as other PA-TNC transactions, as noted in Section 5.2 of PA-TNC
          <xref target="RFC5792"/>. These include, but are not limited to, attribute theft, message
          fabrication, attribute modification, attribute replay, attribute insertion, and denial of service.
          Implementers are advised to consult the PA-TNC specification to better understand these
          security issues.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>As noted in <xref target="Sensitivity-of-collected-tags"/>, if an adversary can gain an understanding 
        of the software installed on an
        endpoint, they can utilize this to launch attacks and maintain footholds on this endpoint. For this
        reason, the NEA Server needs to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to prevent exposure of collected
        inventory records. For similar reasons, it is advisable that an endpoint only send records to a NEA Server that is authorized
        to receive this information and that can be trusted to safeguard this information after collection.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="Relationship" title="Relationship to Other Specifications">
      <t>This specification makes frequent reference to and use of other specifications. This section
        describes these relationships.</t>
        <t>This specification is expected to participate in a standard NEA architecture. As such, it is expected
        to be used in conjunction with the other protocols used in a NEA exchange. 
	In particular, SW Attributes are conveyed over PB-TNC <xref target="RFC5793"/>,
        which is in turn conveyed over some variant of PT (either PT-TLS <xref target="RFC6876"/> or PT-EAP 
	<xref target="RFC7171"/>). 
	These protocols have an
        especially important role, as they are responsible for ensuring that attributes defined under this
        specification are delivered reliably, securely, and to the appropriate party.</t>
        <t>It is important to note that the Product Information, Numeric Version, and String Version attributes
        defined in the PA-TNC specification <xref target="RFC5792"/> are also meant to convey information about
        installed applications and the versions thereof. As such, there is some conceptual overlap between
        those attributes and the intent of this specification. However, PA-TNC was designed to
        respond to very specific queries about specific classes of products, while the Software Inventory Message and
        Attributes for PA-TNC specification is able to convey a broader query, resulting in a more
        comprehensive set of evidence regarding an endpoint's installed software. 
	As such, this specification provides important capabilities not
        present in the PA-TNC specification.</t>

      <t>The name for this registry is "Software Data Model Types". Each entry in this 
      registry should include a human readable name, an SMI Private Enterprise Number, 
      a decimal integer value between 1 and 2^8-1 (inclusive), and a reference to the 
      specification where the use of this data model is defined. This specification needs 
      to provide both a description of the format used by the data model and the procedures 
      by which Software Identifiers are derived from a record expressed using this data model. 
      Note that a specification that just defines the data model structure and its use is generally 
      not sufficient as it would likely lack the procedures for constructing a Software Identifier. 
      This is why the table below references the current specification for ISO SWID tags, 
      rather than using the actual ISO SWID tag specification.</t> 
      <t>The following entries for this registry are defined in this document. They are 
      the initial entries in the registry for Software Data Model Types. Additional entries to 
      this registry are added by Expert Review with Specification Required, following the 
      guidelines in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
